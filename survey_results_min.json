This will be done by conducting an analysis that is both quantitative and qualitative.    The quantitative part of the analysis will consist in comparing the performance of each country in the Integrated Index for Postal Development (2IPD), in the UN SDG indicators and in other benchmarks (EoB and LPI). Any positive residuals will indicate outperformance.     The qualitative part of the analysis will consist in collecting and assessing case studies of SDG projects in the postal sector.

The cooperation reflects a vision integrating development strategies at the global, regional and national levels. Global priorities were defined during the 2016 UPU Congress, with a priority on improving operational efficiency and the development of e-commerce.     The UPU regional Development Plans (RDP) define actions and engagements with stakeholder groups at the country and regional level. RDP have been approved for each of the 6 UPU regions, with specific projects focusing on capacity building in Financial Inclusion, Digital transformation and diversification and Operational Efficiency for E-commerce.     Technical assistance to governments in two countries (Tunisia and Morocco) towards reducing the export frictions for MSME by empowering the universal postal network to support MSME across the country \u2013 directly contributing to SDG 17.11.    Moreover, beyond the cooperation and development function, the UPU conducts a number of projects in areas which support the ability of countries to achieve SDG-relevant goals.    Climate change    UPU provides postal operators in all its 192 member countries with access to a free tool and technical support to measure and analyse their climate impact. UPU also provides support, best practice exchange and capacity building on sustainability to its member countries and postal operators worldwide, including knowledge sharing on climate mitigation. In addition, UPU provides technical assistance and capacity building to its member countries on disaster risk reduction and preparedness.    The UPU participates in UN Environment     Financial inclusion: activities of the UPU linked to the relevant SDGs     Financial inclusion as a key tool for poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth   According to the 2014 Global Findex, 2 billion adults worldwide do not have access to formal financial services. Groups of people that are the most financially excluded include the poor, people out of a job (unemployed or retired), or women. Yet access to formal financial services is a key lever for socio-economic development, as recognized in six of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, and 10). When confronted with a life shock (illness, accident, natural disaster, etc.), access to insurance, savings, or remittance services can be the difference between resilience or sinking below the poverty line. Similarly, easy access to various payment services or to loans can help empower people, create livelihoods including though small businesses, which can then lead to increased wealth and job creation in their community.   Posts have traditionally been strong financial inclusion contributors and remain so. As shown in the 2016  UPU Global panorama of postal financial inclusion, Posts are the second biggest contributor to financial inclusion worldwide, after banks, but \u201Cfar ahead of microfinance institutions, money-transfer organizations, cooperatives, insurance companies, mobile money operators and all other providers of financial services\u201D.  Indeed, 1 billion people worldwide in 87 countries hold a total of 2 billion payment or savings accounts at Posts. Furthermore, 183 Posts \u2013 or 91% of all Posts \u2013 offer at least one type of financial service. As such, apart from the 1 billion account holders, an estimated 500 million additional people worldwide access payment services such as remittances or government payments through a post office.   Link to the 2016 Global panorama:  http:\/\/www.upu.int\/uploads\/tx_sbdownloader\/globalPanoramaOnPostalFinancialInclusion2016En.pdf   But these massive numbers are not the only reason why Posts are so important to financial inclusion. It is also that Posts, as institutions typically with public good missions, have a mandate to address the needs of all populations, and not just the urban, the well-off, or the more educated. Two recent studies led by UN Women and the UPU, and by the World Bank and the UPU, support that statement. They show that Posts are comparatively better than other financial institutions in banking segments of the population that tend to be excluded, such as women,  the poor, the less educated and those in the informal economy.    If we add to this the extensive physical network of Posts \u2013 more than 660,000 locations worldwide, present in rural areas as much as urban areas \u00AC\u2013 and the trust factor from which a large number of Posts benefit, we realize that Posts are in fact uniquely positioned to advance financial inclusion.  In a study published in 2013 with the World Bank, (\u201CFinancial Inclusion and the Role of the Post Office\u201D) looks at the profile of people that are using financial services offered by Post. It clearly concludes that compared to banks, Posts have a much larger proportion of clients that are usually in the most financially excluded categories of population, such as the poor or those in the informal economy.    Posts as a driver for women economic empowerment through financial inclusion  The access to financial services for women is widely recognized as a key driver for women\u2019s economic empowerment. A joint study led by UNWomen and the UPU demonstrates the non-discriminatory nature of Posts in the provision of financial services. Greater financial inclusion of women is a win-win development strategy with the potential to positively impact growth and human development as well as women\u2019s social and economic empowerment. The joint UNWomen\/UPU study demonstrates that postal services have a vital role to play in this process and a positive and measurable impact.   On average, in developing countries, postal financial institutions (postal banks or postal savings banks) have twice as many female customers as other financial institutions. This phenomenon is even more marked in rural areas.   Link to the study:   http:\/\/www.upu.int\/uploads\/tx_sbdownloader\/genderAndFinancialInclusionThroughThePostEn.pdf     Expanding the access to insurance services through the postal networks   Insurance is one of four pillars of financial inclusion. Insurance products can make a significant positive difference in the lives of vulnerable individuals by helping households mitigate shocks and improve the management of expenses related to unforeseen events such as medical emergencies, a death in the family, theft or natural disasters. However, there is a persistent insurance gap, particularly in developing countries.   A joint study conducted by the UPU and the International Labor organization (ILO\u2019s Impact Insurance Facility) demonstrates how Posts can serve as an inclusive distribution channel for insurance products to excluded populations in developing countries.    Link to the study:  http:\/\/www.upu.int\/uploads\/tx_sbdownloader\/advancingFinancialInclusionThroughAccessToInsuranceTheRoleOfPostalNetworksEn.pdf     Lowering the cost of remittances for migrants   In the early 2000s, the UPU developed the International Financial System (IFS), a money transfer tool that it makes available to Posts. In accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 10c, which is to reduce to less than 3% the transaction costs of migrant remittances by 2030, the UPU helps Posts offer their customers secure and affordable services. Over 80 Posts currently use IFS, which was updated in 2013 for use on mobile devices and which can be man\u00ACaged remotely via cloud computing for Posts that do not have sufficient technical capacity.   According to the World Bank, post offices are the world's cheapest providers of remittance services. Posts have already reached the 5X5 objective, with an average cost of about 4%. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, if all remittances were channelled through post offices at that cost, migrants and their families could save up to 3.2 billion USD a year. A project led by the UPU and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in the rural areas of six West African countries between 2008 and 2010, showed that connecting rural post offices had a strong impact on costs for customers, with prices going down by 30 to 50% in the region as a consequence of the project.     UPU\u2019s endeavor in leveraging postal networks to advance financial inclusion   In parallel to this operational and regulatory work in the field of money transfers, the UPU has also been implementing since 2008 a series of activities in the field of financial inclusion. Most of this was scaled up starting in 2011, with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The UPU\u2019s financial inclusion agenda can be divided in three complementary pillars:  \\u2022\\tResearch: the UPU, on its own or in partnership with other institutions, has led extensive research activities on the contribution of Posts to financial inclusion. Those researches clearly demonstrates the role Posts play a very important roel in providing financial services to the populations excluded from the formal financial services markets ( women, poor, rural populations)   \\u2022\tAdvocacy and partnerships: The UPU is leading a series of activities years to ensure that the postal sector was recognized as a valuable contributor to financial inclusion and has built strategic partnerships with a number of UN (World Bank, the International Labour Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, UN Women), and non UN organizations (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, CGAP) and private sector companies. Those partners are increasingly recognizing Posts as valuable partners to advance financial inclusion.  \\u2022\tTechnical Assistance (TA):   UPU TA has been provided on the following topics:  -\tAssistance to Posts to design new business models;   -\tAssistance to Central Banks to help them better understand the scope of financial services offered by Posts and the different models of regulations;  -\tAssistance to Posts for the establishment of partnerships with mobile money operators or banks;  -\tDesign and launch of new digital financial services.  In parallel, the UPU is conducting country-level specific projects with other partners, which link financial inclusion through the post and local economic development. This is the case for example in Burundi, where a joint project with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is currently being implemented.

For instance, partnerships with statistical offices of other organizations such as UNCTAD, WTO, OECD, WCO, ICAO and the World Bank have been sought with the aim of improving the data and insights associated with infrastructure and electronic services (pertinent to Goal 9 of the UN SDGs). UPU also works in partnership with WMO on issues relating to environment, climate and resilience. UPU is an active contributor to Sustainable United Nations, through which we collaborate with other UN agencies on coherent environmental strategies and their implementation.    In a report organized by the ITU and launched at the High-level Policy Forum (HLPF) held in New York from 10 to 19 July 2017 , UN agencies recognized that information and communication technologies (ICTs) constituted both a risk and an opportunity in terms of achieving the UN SDGs. The UPU contributed to this report with a thought piece that showed how the organization, as a unique knowledge centre for the postal sector, can leverage information and communication technologies (ICTs) in order to collect, share and analyze data that supports development policies.     As an example of this expertise, the UPU highlighted the work done in the context of the UPU–UN Global Pulse partnership, which revealed that by leveraging ICTs, the UPU's big data was able to generate reliable social and economic development indicators, even in cases of patchy macroeconomic data (e.g. where local statistical capabilities are weak). This data is invaluable for policymakers, donors, fundraisers, project managers and all key stakeholders in the technical cooperation arena who are eager to measure the potential and actual impact of projects in the field.    Another example is the UPU’s leadership role in a workstream of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), coordinating Action Line C7 (e-business) with UNCTAD and the International Trade Centre (ITC). A full report of the progress made in the implementation of the outcomes of WSIS is published every year by the UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development.     During the WSIS Forum in May 2017, the UPU promoted the contribution of the postal network and of UPU projects (e.g. ECOMPRO and the Easy Export Programme) in enabling SMEs to actively use e-commerce and better leverage the digital economy, so as to meet SDG target 17.11 on export growth in least developed countries and other developing countries. In addition, during the 2016 WSIS Forum, the UPU organized a thematic workshop entitled \"Innovations and reflections on how the postal network can ensure the global reach of digital services to better serve citizens\". At the workshop, governments, regulators and other industry stakeholders from Botswana, Ireland, Morocco, Paraguay and Tunisia discussed the need to innovate using existing networks and capabilities in their countries.    In 2017, the UPU's postal network statistics were again integrated into the UN global e-commerce readiness index.  The report published annually by UNCTAD identifies key recommendations for policymakers on the development of e-commerce, involving universal postal delivery infrastructures, the need for a national addressing system, the availability of alternative payment solutions, and the increased efficiency of cross-border e-commerce through postal supply chain improvements.    The UPU is a founding member along with many other UN organisations of the multi-stakeholder partnership “eTrade-for-all”, launched in 2016. The eTrade for all initiative aims at addressing existing knowledge gaps and maximizing synergies between beneficiary countries, partners and donors so everyone can get more from e-Trade. Effective development of e-commerce requires cross-sectoral and cross-institutional approaches, making collaboration essential. Therefore eTrade for all partners include international organizations, regional development banks, national agencies as well as representatives from the private sector. This has a direct impact on SDG 17.9: Enhance international support for implementing effective and targeted capacity-building in developing countries to support national plans to implement all the sustainable development goals, including through North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation.     The UPU is cooperating with other UN Organizations in the field of financial inclusion and the reduction of cost for international remittances (World Bank, ITU, IFAD, IOM). Those country-led projects have a direct impact on the cost of remittances for migrants which is one the target under SDG 8 ( 10.c By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent). When the posts enter the market of remittances with its own product or UPU product: costs of remittances are reduced by the other market players. Currently a joint project with the International Organization for Migration is being implemented in Burundi, which aims at reducing the costs of remittances for the diaspora and increase the level of financial inclusion of the families in the country of origin.

Guided by the theme “Delivering sustainable development: Connecting citizens, businesses and territories,” ministers’ discussions reaffirmed the Post’s role as a driver of global development. More than 50 ministers in charge of the postal sector gathered for the conference.  Indeed, for almost every one of the SDGs, postal networks around the globe are already providing solutions – either alone or in partnership with others sectors and networks. Fostering social and financial inclusion, facilitating trade and commerce, and delivering innovation and the information society to all are the key areas of the postal contribution to this world agenda for development. These areas of focus underline governments’ priorities and are also indicators for governmental investment and policy, and for international development partners and donors.  The discussion at the 2016 Ministerial Conference centered on inclusion, trade and the digital economy, since these were considered the three main drivers of national development that the Post is involved in delivering with the Sustainable Development Goals.  Panelists considered for instance the Post’s far-reaching network to drive social and financial inclusion. One example put forward was Kenya’s Huduma Centre concept, where citizens in remote areas can access vital government services through the extensive postal network in the country.    Ministers also lauded the role of the Post in facilitating global trade, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), who often find it difficult to export their goods.  Furthermore, speakers noted the important role played by the Post’s physical network in connecting customers to the digital world and facilitating the transition to serving a new, younger market. They also pointed out that the Post collects data in key areas, such as communications, logistics, transport and finance, which could also be used to better serve customers.   Financial inclusion   In 2017, the UPU organized 4 regional conferences gathering more than 70 countries with the objectives of promoting its technical assistance programme (FITAF) among its members countries and creating a platform of exchanges of experiences with private sector operators in the space of digital financial services. The objectives of the UPU Financial Inclusion Technical Assistance Facility (FITAF) technical assistance is to support UPU member countries in implementing digital financial services and improve he access to financial services to unbanked populations in 20 countries by 2020.","8.

In your view, what should a strategic plan for the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs look like? What key elements should it include and major challenges address in such a road map?":"The main challenge faced by UN-System organizations in aligning their actions to the SDGs is the missing link between, on the one hand, the goals, targets and indicators that constitute the SDG measurement framework and, on the other hand, the specific quantitative impact of the activities of these organizations.     Indeed, many organizations may struggle to identify to what extent their specific projects in the field have enabled the indicator X to move from value Y to Z in country A. In this sense, whenever positive movements in the value of the indicator are observed, these organizations may simply assume that their activities (or those of national governments) have contributed to the overall impact, without any specific quantitative backing.    Therefore, when drafting their new strategies and whenever possible, it is advisable that, beyond conducting mere SDG mapping (focusing on topics covered), UN organizations define quantitative key performance indicators that express the specific expected impacts of their actions in terms of SDGs.   ","10. Please indicate one or two endeavor or initiatives you suggest that the UN system organizations could undertake together to support the implementation of the SDGs between now and 2030:":"Looking at how to better implement the SDGs, a specific initiative to focus on how the specialized agencies, with their specific industry stakeholders at the national level  (eg. UPU – postal sector, WMO – meteorological, ITU – telecoms, FAO – Agricultural) can be leveraged as implementation partners for UN system policies and projects of the 2030 agenda. Eg. SDG 16.9 - by 2030 provide legal identity for all. The UPU could mobilize its industry stakeholders and their networks of over 650,000 post office locations.in rural and remote communities to service ID delivery infrastructures developed by other UN system or specialized agencies.    Implementation at country level: need for a better coordination between UN organizations    As a non-resident agency (NRÀ), the UPU faces many challenges in the implementation of SDG related projects and activities at country level. A better coordination at country level with the resident agencies and the other UN entities present on the ground would be beneficial in term of impacts.

The Strategy is a bold call to action to Fast-Track the AIDS response and reach people being left behind. It is explicitly anchored in Agenda 2030 and organized SDGs where shared progress will be critical to ending AIDS as a public health threat.    Coherent and integrated support, as called for in the 2030 Agenda, is a pillar of the UNAIDS Strategy which outlines how UNAIDS will lead and coordinate the AIDS response, address social, economic and political drivers of the AIDS epidemic, leverage the AIDS response to tackle broader global health challenges, and ensure no one is left behind.    The Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS, adopted in 2016: http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2016/2016-political-declaration-HIV-AIDS was the first UNGA Declaration to include regional targets after the adoption of the SDGs.

The 2016-2021 UBRAF is structured based on the SDGs: the five SDGs that are most relevant to the AIDS response (SDG 3, SDG 10, SDG 5, SDG 16, SDG 17) (ref. Page 8 of the 2016-2021 revised UBRAF document: http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20160623_UNAIDS_PCB38_16-10_Revised_UBRAF_EN.pdf). Bringing together efforts of 12 organizations into one framework, the UBRAF reflects calls under the SDGs for issue-based coalitions, joint programming, joint teams and attribution to collective results.    The UBRAF outlines the role of the Joint Programme in the AIDS response in the context of other stakeholders and efforts. It guides UNAIDS’ operational planning at global, regional and country levels by identifying the expected results of the Joint Programme, providing the framework against which budgetary allocations are made as well as the basis for performance monitoring, reporting and accountability of the Joint Programme.    The UBRAF is designed to maximize the coherence, effectiveness and impact of the HIV-related resources of the United Nations – delivering as one. Through the UNAIDS’ Division of Labour between and among the Cosponsors and the Secretariat, the UBRAF focuses Cosponsor and Secretariat support, taking into account the comparative advantages and mandates of each organization, in-country presence, and existing national capacities and resources, as well as added value of joint initiatives and effective collaboration.    The 2016–2021 UBRAF comprises a broad range of monitoring and evaluation tools to measure the performance of the Joint Programme. Quantitative data, using indicators, are combined with narrative descriptions and analyses of progress, external assessments, reviews and independent evaluations to triangulate results and provide a more complete picture of what has been achieved. Comparing to the previous UBRAF framework, the number of indicators has been reduced to facilitate joint analyses of country level progress and evidence-based programming. A web-based tool, the JPMS, facilitates collecting, collating and analysing performance information. Data entry starts at the country level and is performed by Joint United Nations Teams on AIDS or similar structures.","Readjusting or updating results-based budgeting and management, including performance indicators:":"In its first year, the 2016–2021 UBRAF proved to be an effective framework for guiding the work of the Joint Programme at all levels. This was due particularly to a clearer and simpler structure; fewer outputs (20 compared to 64 previously); improved reflection of regional differences and priorities; and a theory of change linking UBRAF outputs to higher-level results and the SDGs, explaining how the Joint Programme contributes to outcomes and impact. The review of the 2016–2021 UBRAF as a resource planning and accountability framework showed stronger linkages than in the past between the UBRAF framework and operational plans of the Joint Programme at country and regional levels. The simplified framework facilitated communication, improved coherence and clarified expectations about Joint Programme support. Joint work has become the rule rather than the exception. Examples of the Joint Programme working effectively include the Global Plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections among children and keeping their mothers alive (Global Plan), the Global Commission on HIV and the Law and its follow-up, and the All-In initiative.","Action to enhance support to the principle of \"leaving no one behind\" and to integrated policy approaches:":"At the country level, the UNDAF is always used as the primary in-country reference document which is then, in many countries, complemented by the Joint UN Programme of Support on AIDS (another multi entity plan) which is implemented by Joint UN Teams on AIDS.

At the country level UNAIDS works through Joint UN Teams on AIDS which are composed of all Cosponsors present in-country (established by the SG as a part of the RC system in 2003) and Joint UN Programmes of Support on HIV which serve as the joint planning framework for all UN work relating to HIV and AIDS in-country.    All UNAIDS major publications are developed jointly with Cosponsors and are reviewed by the UN system agencies. All major data and information systems and tools, including AIDSinfo, key populations atlas, etc. are open source and available free. These platforms have supported and informed numerous UN organisations. JPMS is a joint UN tool that shares knowledge of activities, programmes and progress. Country level Joint UN Teams on AIDS use the JPMS platform for knowledge sharing.    UNAIDS website regularly publishes web-stories highlighting joint UN work and achievements, in addition to providing links to Cosponsor sites on thematic areas.    UNAIDS actively engages in the CEB, UNDG, HLCM and HLCP.","6. How has your organization engaged with stakeholder groups, both in supporting implementation at the country, regional and global levels, and within your own organization? If yes, please provide main highlights, including any lessons learned:":"Through its multi-sectoral, multi-stakeholder approach, the UNAIDS Strategy aims to advance country-level progress towards ending AIDS while contributing to broader health, development, gender and rights outcomes.    The Strategy promotes the advancement of a rights-based, inclusive approach that ensures a people-centred response built on participation of civil society, women, young people, people living with HIV and key populations – leaving no one behind. Some examples:    P3 (foreword): “Ending the AIDS epidemic will involve progress across the entire spectrum of rights: civil, cultural, economic, political, social, sexual and reproductive. Defending the rights of all people—including children, women, young people, men who have sex with men, people who use drugs, sex workers and clients, transgender people and migrants—is critical to ensuring access to life-saving services. Through the realization of their rights, people being left behind will move ahead, to the very forefront of the journey to end AIDS— informed and empowered, mobilized and engaged.”    P7: Entire section on ‘Putting people at the centre of the three zeros’. Excerpt: “Ending the AIDS epidemic and leaving no one behind in the response will profoundly affect the entire lifespan of millions of people around the world, for generations to come. The post-AIDS world will be very different from the one we know today—and it is one we can create.” The Strategy focuses on achieving concrete results for populations most affected by the HIV epidemic, women and girls in high prevalence countries as well as men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who use drugs, transgender people, prisoners and migrants depending on epidemiological context. (See the summary of the results areas on pages 10 and 11 of the Strategy: http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/20151027_UNAIDS_PCB37_15_18_EN_rev1.pdf).    Efforts to close access gaps among populations currently being left behind prioritize integration of HIV care with related services, which enhances the impact of the HIV response, reduces commodity costs and capitalizes on alternative service delivery models, and removing punitive laws and policies, as well as stigma and discrimination that negatively impact on the access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support.","7. Has your organization organized any conferences, forums or events designed to facilitate exchange of experience, peer and mutual learning? If yes, please provide a brief summary below and include lessons learned and gaps identified based on the outcomes of these events. Please also include any events you plan to organize in the coming years.":"The UNAIDS Secretariat facilitates regular knowledge exchanges:    first, in the context of the Programme Coordinating Board (PCB) of the UNAIDS Joint Programme where two types of events are organized: a thematic segment of the PCB and a field visit.    second, in activities at country level in the Joint UN Teams on AIDS.    And third, in the context of other UN and multilateral meetings, such as the Social Forum of the Human Rights Council, where at its 2017 session, the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of the HIV epidemic and other communicable diseases and epidemics was presented.    Furthermore, the UNAIDS joint Programme leverages International AIDS conferences (Durban in 2015), Francophone AIDS conferences and regional conferences such as ICASA in Africa (Côte d’Ivoire in 2016) and APAC in Asia-pacific to promote knowledge exchanges.    Lessons learned: the mix of international, regional and local events constitute an important strategy to share knowledge, but it is also an important opportunity to promote a global supportive movement which is essential for the realization of the 2030 Agenda.","8.

In your view, what should a strategic plan for the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs look like? What key elements should it include and major challenges address in such a road map?":"A strategic plan should seek to:    · Act on low-hanging fruit: Need to demonstrate that the UN can take swift action – choose one or two areas where it can quickly reposition, and feature this as an example of substantive change and progress (for example, in the way the SG led the development of the System-Wide Strategy on Gender Parity)    · Focus on results and value added of the UN: governance and mandates should not get in the way of prioritisation and a focus on quality, excellence, results and value added of the UN, particularly related laws, norms, human rights, common positions and regional public goods. The importance of drawing on the comparative advantages of the UN and the need to ensure consistency, coherence and coordination at the regional level were highlighted and the role of the UN in providing thought leadership and ensuring policy coherence was stressed throughout the day.    · Be forward-looking: Need to use data, science and evidence as basis for policy and joint and predictive analyses - not just identifying solutions to today’s problems, but also where problems might be in the future. Key for the UN to position itself as a leader today and in the future.","10. Please indicate one or two endeavor or initiatives you suggest that the UN system organizations could undertake together to support the implementation of the SDGs between now and 2030:":"Work planning and reporting – Stronger message on UN responding to cross-cutting needs of countries not UN entity mandates. Concrete recommendation: UN should deliver one consolidated report per country on strategic high-level results, not every entity reporting separately.    On data, the UN should be more ambitious. It should not only be about disaggregating data but pooling data. Concrete recommendation: UN should provide a one-stop-shop for data for the SDGs – where members of the public can see real-time data – would drive democratization of data, accountability and citizen engagement e.g. situation room for AIDS – why not health?

{"show":1,"Organization":"World Trade Organization","Short":"WTO","q1":"Yes. The WTO has done work on several of the SDG targets that pertain to trade.  Beginning with SDG 2 on Zero Hunger, more specifically target 2 (b) which urges the reduction of distortions in agricultural markets. The WTO's Export Competition in Agriculture Decision reached at the Nairobi Ministerial Conference delivers on this target by prohibiting the use of export subsidies and other measures of equivalent effect. Similarly with SDG 3 on Good Health, an amendment to the WTO TRIPS Agreement entered into force will make it easier for developing countries to have a secure legal pathway to access affordable medicines in line with target 3 (b).  Also, for SDG 8, the WTO continues to be successful in mobilizing resources under the Aid for Trade initiative in line with target 8 (a).  To date almost USD 300 billion has been disbursed for aid-for-trade support, mainly in Asia (41.5 per cent) and Africa (38.7 per cent), with 27 per cent of the total going to LDCs. Continuing with SDG 10 regarding Reducing Inequality, the principle of the Special and Differential treatment continues to be a strong pillar of WTO rules and is reflected in all new agreements, as for example in the Trade Facilitation Agreement which has a whole section dedicated to very innovative Special and Differential Treatment provisions.  Finally, on SDG 14 concerning Life Below Water, at the WTO's Eleventh Ministerial Conference Members adopted a Ministerial Decision on Fisheries subsidies. Under this decision, members agreed to continue to engage constructively in the fisheries subsidies negotiations with a view to adopting an agreement by the next Ministerial Conference in 2019 on comprehensive and effective disciplines that prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, and eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing Members also re-committed to implementation of existing notification obligations under Article 25.3 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures thus strengthening transparency with respect to fisheries subsidies. While this obligation is not new, good faith, accurate and truthful notifications can improve the level of understanding on current subsidisation practices in the fishing sector by WTO Members. The Decision on Fisheries Subsidies is a step forward in multilateral efforts to comply with SDG target 14.6, in that for the first time, the WTO membership has committed itself to achieving this target and to fulfilling this commitment by MC12, in 2019.","q2_1":"Yes.

The WTO has worked closely with UCTAD and ITC, in what it calls the Geneva trade hub, to provide support to members in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda and in monitoring progress towards its achievement. The WTO also provides content on the Sustainable Development Goals indicators website which contributes to the annual report.  In collaboration with UNCTAD and ITC, the overhauling of the MDG-trade.org website is in the works and should be relaunched as SDG-trade.org. This website will allow for the easy tracking of progress towards the different trade-related targets of the SDGs and also allow any agency that uses it to generate their own statistics.  Partnership with the World Bank and IMF has also produced publications on the role of trade in ending poverty and making trade an engine of growth for all.  WTO also participates regularly at meetings of the CEB and its subsidiary bodies in particular the HLCP. The WTO participates very actively to the different CEB led initiatives in the framework of the wider UN system response to the SDGs implementation.  ","6. How has your organization engaged with stakeholder groups, both in supporting implementation at the country, regional and global levels, and within your own organization? If yes, please provide main highlights, including any lessons learned:":"One of the main ways WTO engages with stakeholder groups is through the Global review on Aid for Trade. The latest of these Global reviews was held in Geneva 11 to 13 July 2017. The Global Review emphasized the close synergy and correlation between Aid for Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.  Achieving sustainable, inclusive economic growth is a key objective for both initiatives and the SDGs call for an \"increase in Aid for Trade support for developing countries, particularly LDCs\".  The trade and development community must ensure that Aid for Trade continues to deliver more and better – and that coherence is improved across the international community. Finally, the Aid for Trade Initiative should continue to spotlight how trade and connectivity can empower youth, women, micro, small and medium enterprises and the youth.  WTO also engages with stakeholders during its annual Public Forum. The 2017 Public Forum was held in September under the theme of \"Trade: Behind the Headlines\". During the three-day duration of the Public Forum over 32 of the sessions focused on issues related to sustainable development, inclusive trade and economic growth, and the role of trade in achieving the SDGs.   The WTO also engages with multiple stakeholders with its Outreach activities within the framework of the WTO Trade Related Technical Assistance. In 2017 the WTO organized 8 such activities targeting Members of Parliament, NGOs, Media and Business representatives. These activities were held in different regions of the World and had a focus on preparing the WTO 11th Ministerial Conference as well Trade's contribution to attaining the SDGs.  ","7.

In your view, what should a strategic plan for the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs look like? What key elements should it include and major challenges address in such a road map?":"Any strategic plan for the UN system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda needs to mainstream trade at the multilateral and national level. Because of its special role in sustainable development, more and more governments are adopting strategies which aim to mainstream trade into their national sustainable development strategies. The broad links of trade to other sectors, and the fact that plans and investments are most often driven and owned by non-trade specific stakeholders, require that trade policies and mechanisms need to be effectively mainstreamed into national as well as specific sector sustainable development plans. Such an approach ensures that all stakeholders act coherently in the use of trade as a proactive tool in achieving poverty reduction and fulfilling other SDGs. Therefore, trade needs to be mainstreamed at the levels of policy, institutions and resourcing; this could help countries achieve a range of SDG targets, including those that relate to participation in international trade, decent work and sustainable economic growth, reducing poverty, and strengthening environmental protection.    This strategic plan should also work towards strengthening the Multilateral Trading System since despite recent successes the system needs to continue delivering results in order to correct existing imbalances and adapt to the changing nature of international trade. There remains work to do to eliminate all restrictions and distortions in agricultural markets, continue improving market access in goods and services, including those which directly support the achievement of particular SDGs such as SDG:7 on clean and affordable energy or SDG:6 on clean water, and tackle other issues such as curbing subsidies that cause overfishing. WTO has already started this work and members are exploring possible measures in a range of areas. The ability of the trading system to continue support inclusive growth, jobs and poverty reduction depends on its continued strength. WTO members should therefore keep working to improve and strengthen the system, while also resisting protectionist policies. A strong trading system will be essential in delivering the SDGs, just as it was in delivering the MDGs.","10.

SHAA2030 builds on the Pan American Health Organization\u2019s (PAHO) Health Agenda for the Americas 2008-2017, unfinished business from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the uniqueness of the 2030 Agenda. It represents the highest-level policy and strategic planning framework for the Region and serves as a call to action for Member States to work to achieve a healthier and more equitable Region of the Americas, as envisioned by the SDGs.  This Agenda will be implemented through PAHO strategic plans and strategies, as well as through sub-regional and national health plans.  \u2022\tThe Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO\/PAHO) is currently considering a Strategy and Roadmap developed to help guide Member States in implementing actions to realize the SDGs.  Based on the key principles of equity and sustainability, the institutional strategy uses innovation and multi-sectoral approaches to incorporate other sectors as partners. The Roadmap will lead to better inter-programmatic collaboration and coordination between programs and the SDG targets they address, particularly those related to health. It will also help establish a unified regional response, optimize national and regional development efforts, and avoid duplication, waste and multiple reporting structures that place an undue burden on Member States. Ultimately, the Roadmap maintains a central focus on country needs and priorities, as opposed to a broad-brush regional approach, and will require Country Cooperation Strategies (CCSs) to include health and health-related SDG targets at the national level. This is in-keeping with the new global CCS Guidelines from the WHO.  \u2022\tExecutive staff, including AMRO\u2019s Director, took part in the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development in April 2017 (Mexico), in which countries in the Americas took stock of the progress made on the SDGs.  The Regional Forum has been set up by Member States of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean to systematically monitor and report on progress and challenges concerning implementation of the SDGs.   \u2022\tAMRO is currently conducting Regional consultations on its Strategy and Plan of Action on Health Promotion within the Context of the SDGs, which seeks to specifically align AMRO\u2019s and the Region\u2019s Health Promotion programming with the 2030 Agenda, both in terms of priorities and in terms of modes of multi-sectoral programming.  This Strategy and Plan of Action incorporates four strategic lines of action explicitly focused on bringing together the tools of Health Promotion and the vision of the 2030 Agenda:  \u2022\tRevitalizing the Healthy Settings Approach with a particular focus on local action  \u2022\tStrengthening partnerships and participation through good governance  \u2022\tAdopting health literacy for equity and empowerment  \u2022\tReorienting health services (prioritizing both UHC and determinants of health)  \u2022\tIn 2017, the WHO Regional Committee for Europe, at its 67th session endorsed the Roadmap to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, building on Health 2020, the European policy for health and well-being. The roadmap aims to strengthen the capacities of Member States, to achieve better, more equitable, sustainable health and well-being for all at all ages in the WHO European Region. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires working in a transformative way in order to implement a set of coherent, evidence-informed policies that address health, well-being and all their determinants throughout the life-course and across all sectors of government and society. Revitalized global and regional partnerships are essential and will provide the essential support and momentum to this joint societal and global effort. This roadmap proposes five interdependent strategic directions: advancing governance and leadership for health and well-being; leaving no one behind; preventing disease and addressing health determinants by promoting multi- and intersectoral policies throughout the life-course; establishing healthy places, settings and resilient communities; and strengthening health systems for universal health coverage . It proposes four enabling measures to advance the implementation of both the 2030 Agenda and Health 2020: investment for health; multi-partner cooperation; health literacy, research and innovation; monitoring and evaluation.   \u2022\tThe WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) as a follow-up provides support to its Member States in partnership and promotes the progressive alignment of health and development policies or plans;  the achievement of directly and indirectly health-related SDGs and their targets; the use of existing networks and platforms to ensure dialogue between organizations, sectors and countries; and  the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the SDGs. Priorities for the Regional Office will include pursuing the implementation of both the 2030 Agenda and Health 2020 coherently in its work and with individual countries; technical support to countries; its contribution to coordination among United Nations agencies; stronger partnerships and initiatives at the regional and subregional levels; and evidence-informed monitoring and reporting.  \u2022\tThe 67th session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific adopted resolution WPR\/RC67.R5 on \u201CSustainable Development Goals\u201D in October 2016, endorsing the Regional Action Agenda on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Western Pacific.   \u2022\tThe action agenda suggests options for Member States to consider in making the transition from the MDGs to the SDGs based on country-specific contexts, resources and entry points and related WHO support.  It suggests practical actions to achieve the change in mindset that is needed for achieving the SDGs, including new ways of working that go beyond business as usual \u2013 and newer roles and capabilities for the health sector in working across government and stakeholders.   \u2022\tThe action agenda builds on and aligns with existing global and regional strategies, World Health Assembly and Regional Committee resolutions, as well as broader United Nations mandates and guidance. The regional action framework on Universal Health Coverage: Moving Towards Better Health (WPR\/RC66.R2) provides the basis for country-wise development of UHC implementation roadmaps.

Current adjustments are ongoing in the development of national roadmaps, building on the European roadmap. 93% of European Member States adjusted their national health policies to Health 2020. Integrating equity, gender and human rights and addressing the social and environmental determinants of health into multisectoral work is an effort that WHO\/EURO have undertaken since many years.   \u2022\tNormative instruments:   o\tA number of normative instruments on climate, environment and health (e.g. air quality and noise guidelines) in coordination with WHO Headquarters (HQ) and coordinated or contributed to research and innovation on the social, economic and environmental determinants; and developed evidence-based policies for national or sub-national action. Mapping of WHO instruments.   \u2022\tA mapping exercise of World Health Assembly, Regional Committee and other resolutions, strategies and action plans  was conducted to assess the legal and policy instruments available to support the implementation of health-related SDG targets and goals. This exercise led to the creation of two databases (one related to SDG 3 targets and one focused on health in all other SDGs).  \u2022\tGovernance. Governance is also a cross-cutting issue of the SDG roadmap Health 2020 and SDG implementation is supported through four approaches: intersectoral action for health, whole-of-government, Health in All Policies, and governance for health, all of which are underpinned by a whole-of-society approach. These approaches focus on how best to engage key stakeholders, including communities, citizens and businesses in policy implementation, while maintaining a focus on health as a social, environmental, cultural and economic goal.   \u2022\tProducing a resource kit for Member States. Following a request from Member States, EURO is developing a resource kit for Member States, building on material developed across the organization. This resource kit in particular should support the Member States in getting started, in integrating health and well-being into national and subnational development plans, support to implementation, monitoring and evaluation.   \u2022\tSDG health targets factsheets. SDG factsheets have been created to synthesize the evidence-base on key health targets in order to promote coherence and better address the burden of disease throughout the Region. Currently, SDG factsheets  have been produced on communicable and noncommunicable disease (NCD), climate change, road safety, vaccine coverage, antimicrobial resistance, essential medicines, hazardous chemicals, sexual and reproductive health services, mental health, maternal health, child and adolescent health and migration and health and others are under development. It was agreed that these factsheets present important information and should be included in the technical annex.  \u2022\tIn line with the Regional Action Agenda on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Western Pacific, there has been strong commitment and senior management leadership to facilitate the mindset change implied by the SDGs also within the WHO Western Pacific Region.  For example, the SDGs were the topic of two Consultations of WHO Representatives and Country Liaison Officers in the Western Pacific Region (April and November 2016).  \u2022\tThe SDGs and UHC also call for stronger coordination and collaboration across different health programme areas and teams. WPRO has set up two cross-divisional working groups to foster collaboration on (1) MDG\/SDGs and (2) Gender and Social Determinants.  \u2022\tThe medium-term strategic vision for cooperation between WHO and individual countries is represented in the WHO country cooperation strategies (CCS).  All CCSs developed in the Western Pacific Region since 2016 have explicitly recognized the importance of the SDGs, and the SDGs have been specifically considered during the formulation of the strategic priorities with each country.  \u2022\tFormulation of the two year programme of collaboration with countries, identifying specific activities that WHO will support during that period, are then formulated taking into account the priorities of the CCS.      ","Mainstreaming the SDGs in development plans and policies or through national sustainable development plans/strategies:":"Regional Level  o\\tAs described above, the document \u201CPreparing the Region of the Americas to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goal on Health\u201D supports countries in mainstreaming the SDGs in national development plans and policies. A series of national consultations have taken place, both virtually and in-person, to integrate.  o\tThirty European countries have requested some sort of support. This ranges from integrating the SDGs into national health plans, including health into the VNRs, supporting the integration of health into national development plans, assessing investment for health, and integrating health into sectoral policies and interventions. A series of national consultations have taken place, from country missions to policy dialogue and high level presidential meetings.","Mainstreaming the SDGs in sectoral strategies, including specific SDG/target strategies:":"Global Level  o\\tWHO provides support to countries to develop their health sector strategies and disease specific programme strategies. The CDS cluster has supported many countries to address SDG 3.3 within the context of UHC (SDG 3.8).  o\tWHO has moved towards HIV Treat All guidelines consistent with universal coverage and ending AIDS.

HIV has also launched its person centered monitoring guidelines, to strengthen disaggregated data.    Regional level  o\tDeveloping a common set of indicators for the joint monitoring framework for SDGs, Health 2020 and the Global NCD Action Plan (2017) In order to address concerns raised by Member States on the burden of reporting to WHO and other international bodies, Member States at the 67th session of the Regional Committee for Europe (RC67) agreed to adopt a joint monitoring framework for reporting on indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals, Health 2020 and the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases through the endorsement of resolution EUR\/RC67\/R3 in September 2017. The first step towards the development of a joint monitoring framework was to establish an expert group that would identify a common set of indicators for the joint monitoring framework. That group met in Vienna, Austria, on 20\u201321 November 2017. This report provides a summary of that meeting, including the process of deliberation and resulting recommendations.   ","Science, technology and innovation for the SDGs:":"Global Level  o\\tGMP works closely with the WHO Global Observatory on Health Research and Development and with product development partners to ensure an efficient process to review and recommend new malaria tools and strategy based on high quality evidence review.","Multi-stakeholder partnerships:":"Global Level  o\\tGMP works with the Roll Back Malaria Partnership which is coordinating malaria partners from multiple sectors on joint efforts to maintain high political commitment, resource mobilization and integrate work across multi-sectors at the regional and global levels.  o\tHIV works directly with civil society and UNAIDS in coordinated a multi stakeholder response at country level, in 2018 this has involved joint country envelopes and budgeting across the UN.    Regional Level  \u2022\tMulti-stakeholder partnerships:   o\tIn 2018, AMRO will roll out a Region-specific capacity-building program to support Member States in adapting Health in All Policies approaches, with a strong focus on multi-stakeholder partnerships and including references to the Sustainable Development Goals.   o\tA strong effort is on partnership: In the WHO European Region, the UN Issue-based Coalition on Health and Well-being for All at All Ages has identified four workstreams for collaboration with other UN agencies to support health-related SDG attainment: maternal and child health; tuberculosis, HIV and viral hepatitis; medicines; and migration.   o\tWHO\/Euro also serves member States through the provision of secretariat services, jointly with the The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), to the Protocol on Water and Health, the Transport, Health and Environment Pan-European Programme (THE PEP) and the chairing of the Task force on Health of the UN Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution.   o\tThe South Eastern European Health Network (SEEHN) is an inter-country mechanism through which to promote SDG implementation related to health throughout nine of the Region's Member States. To this end, the 2017 Chisinau Pledge re-enforced country commitments to achieving the SDGs and UHC in addition to identifying emergencies, health workforce and population ageing as policy areas that can be addressed through cross-border work, with the potential to focus these efforts sub-nationally as well. The Small country initiative has started to support the implementation of the SDGs and is in their annual meetings discussing concerted action.   o\tAdditional platforms for promoting health and well-being across the European Region include the Regional Platform for Working Together for Better Health and Well-Being for All and the European Action Plan for Strengthening Public Health Capacities and Services.  o\tThe Environment and Health Process provides a mandate and platform for WHO engagement at this intersection, with the Ostrava Declaration  articulating seven public health priorities for environment and health across the European Region, including: improving air quality for all; ensuring access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene for all; minimizing the adverse effects of chemicals; preventing and eliminating the adverse effects of waste management and contaminated sites; strengthening adaptation to and mitigation of climate change; supporting cities and regions to become healthier; and building the environmental sustainability of health systems.  ","Sub-national plans/strategies and implementation for the SDGs:":" Global Level  o\\tSub-national plans or micro-focus plans are in development for countries pursuing malaria elimination.    Regional Level  o\tWHO has two specific networks targeting the subnational level: the Regions for Health Network (RHN) and the European Healthy Cities Network. RHN is currently comprised of 32 regions. In addition to facilitating peer-to-peer learning across regions, RHN produces publications to share knowledge and best practices, undertakes capacity building activities, gives voice and provides direct exposure to key stakeholders at the sub-national level, and supports communications activities to enhance awareness and visibility on the ground. The European Healthy Cities Network currently consists of 1,400 cities in 30 countries, with 96 WHO flagship-designated cities in total. The Network was founded in 1988 and is preparing to enter its seventh phase, which will be aligned with the 2030 Agenda and guided by the five \u2018Ps\u2019 of sustainable development plus one : people, planet, peace, prosperity, and participation + place. The network is also preparing for its first political summit of mayors to be held in Copenhagen in February 2018. Together, these networks expand the entry points available to WHO in countries.  o\tIn particular, Wales has become an exemplar of SDG localization through the passage and implementation of the Well-being of Future Generations Act, adopted in 2015. In particular, the Welsh case demonstrates the importance of extensive consultation, including over 6,500 individuals, at the local level in order to fully embed and engender a sense of ownership over health-related SDG attainment on the ground. The Welsh strategy is organized around seven well-being goals (a globally responsible, prosperous, resilient, healthier, and more equal Wales with more cohesive communities and vibrant culture and thriving Welsh Language) and five ways of working, including a focus on the long-term, prevention, integration, collaboration and involvement. To assist with implementation, the development of a Health and Sustainability Hub is underway along with a toolkit to support Sustainability Improvement for Teams (SIFT), which is being developed to support the five ways of working through a participatory, iterative development process.  o\tSome key examples in AMRO include:  o\tChile: In order to implement the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, Chile has worked to ensure that the Goals are well integrated into national policies and plans. For example, Chile has developed a National Council comprised of the Minister of External Affairs, Minister of Tourism, Minister of Social Development and Minister of the Environment. Currently, the Council is completing a national analysis on the 17 SDGs and actions needed to achieve them. The analysis includes progress, areas for improvement and challenges.   o\tCosta Rica: Since 2015, Costa Rica has made significant efforts to articulate a multidimensional approach to the implementation of SDGs. In 2016, Costa Rica became the first country to sign a \u201CNational Pact for the Achievement of Sustainable Development Goals,\u201D representing a fundamental consensus to \u2018leave no one behind\u2019.  Signatories included representatives from three government branches, civil society organizations, faith based organizations, public universities, local governments and the business sector.    o\tJamaica: In Jamaica, the adoption of the Agenda has resulted in a review of national development processes in order to maximize synergies between the global agenda and Jamaica\u2019s national development plan, \u201CVision 2030 Jamaica \u2013 National Development Plan\u201D, adopted in 2009. Vision 2030, Jamaica\u2019s first long-term development plan, provides a strategic road map to prepare the country for achieving developed country status by 2030. The plan aims to foster sustainable prosperity by creating conditions in which the country\u2019s productive enterprises are able to generate greater levels of wealth and in which the social and environmental conditions and the general well-being of the society are enhanced.   o\tPeru: In September 2016, Peru began updating national policies, incorporating the guidelines of the 2030 Agenda within sector-specific policies and plans. In October 2016, the first official exercise was carried out to better align sectoral policies with the aims and parameters of Agenda 2030. Peru has also worked to strengthen multilevel governmental coordination, targeting sub-national policies with a territorial approach.","Leveraging interlinkages across SDG goals and targets:":"Global Level  o\\tAll of the above, in collaboration with all levels of the organization and with partners.

Initial priorities for WHO support and engagement included:   o\tCountry and regional monitoring of progress towards UHC and other SDG targets:  WPRO has developed a UHC and SDG M&E framework for the Western Pacific Region (as an annex to the regional action agenda) as well as a baseline report and technical guidance.  o\tIntegrating an equity focus in health programmes, including equity-focused service delivery models and strategic approaches. For example, through collaboration across programmes and offices, WPRO developed a report on advancing health through attention to gender, equity and human rights in 2016\u20132017.  o\tStrengthened partnerships for multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder action that leaves no-one behind, including health in all policies (HiAP) approaches. For example, WHO collaborated with the Government of South Australia in 2017 on a global conference and case study book on progressing the SDGs through HiAP.","Others:":"\u2022\tNational Health Policies: National health policies (NHPs) are a vehicle for enhancing leadership and channeling political support of transformative change for health and well-being for all at all ages. NHPs facilitate the implementation of binding agreements and commitments as well as the diffusion of global and regional policy frameworks related to health and well-being. They also help countries to manage change effectively, set priorities and tailor implementation strategies to their unique country environments. As a result, NHPs play an important role in enhancing policy coherence across agencies, sectors, levels and technical areas in support of both Health 2020 and 2030 Agenda.

Regional Level  \u2022\tAMRO\u2019s strategic planning and programming under the 2030 Agenda has been formulated largely in response to Member State requests for specific guidance.  One highlight has been ensuring that new or revised strategies and initiatives incorporate significant elements of the 2030 Agenda, such as the Strategy and Plan of Action on Health Promotion within the Context of the Sustainable Development Goals (currently under a formalized process of consultation with Member States and other stakeholders through a series of virtual meetings).   \u2022\tAmong efforts to shift the global community's attention to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a five-year interagency collaboration (2016-2021) between PAHO and the Organization of American States (OAS).  This timely partnership aims to identify preliminary joint actions between the two agencies to guide and support Member States in the implementation and achievement of the SDGs, especially those goals outside the scope of the health sector.  The first publication of this strategic alliance aligns each SDG with existing mandates and interagency collaborations, in order to identify existing means and mechanisms that will facilitate the translation of the 2030 Agenda's theories of equity and multisectoral collaboration into policies and processes that can generate positive outcomes for all.  Beyond supporting national and regional action, the mapping aims to simplify coordination and reporting efforts on the part of national governments striving to achieve objectives under multiple international frameworks, and to more closely align the Inter-American and United Nations systems.    \u2022\tEURO\u2019s strategic planning and programming under the 2030 Agenda has been formulated largely in response to Member State requests for specific guidance.  Numerous of the EURO committal documents in 2017 and forthcoming in 2018, have been developed in light of the Agenda 2030 implementation. The EURO roadmap has been discussed by the major stakeholders in its preparations and across agencies.   \u2022\tThe Regional Action Agenda on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Western Pacific also stresses the importance of engaging and working with a broader range of stakeholders, including parliamentary bodies and local and city governments, including mayors.    \u2022\tWPRO has strengthened its collaboration with Parliamentarians through the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarian Forum on Global Health (established in 2015). The forum\u2019s second meeting in Seoul on 24-25 November 2016 focused on the SDGs and resulted in the adoption of the  Seoul Declaration, stressing parliamentarian\u2019s essential role in advancing health in the SDGs through enacting legislation, approving budgets and mobilizing resources, providing oversight to ensure government accountability and transparency, ensuring national implementation of global commitments, and fostering political constituencies.   \u2022\tThe Western Pacific Region also has a long history of collaborating with local and city governments, for example through the healthy cities and healthy islands movements. The central place of cities and communities was most recently recognized in the Shanghai Consensus on Healthy Cities (2016), adopted by more than 100 mayors at the 9th Global Conference on Health Promotion.  \u2022\tSenior WPRO staff regularly promote the SDGs and work towards them through keynote addresses at major Regional, country-level and international conferences (e.g. the Asia Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health meeting (Seoul), the Asia Pacific Public Health Conference (Malaysia) and the Japan Society for international Health.    \u2022\tWHO South Pacific representative office has supported Fiji, Kiribati and Tonga to attend 1st and 2nd UHC Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting with in-country experience in expanding health service coverage and enhancing health finance. The office also convened a subregional consultation meeting: to share evidence and best practice of health system strengthening; to discuss the current gaps in health service delivery; and to articulate recommendations for achieving Healthy Islands vision with regard to UHC.  \u2022\tIn Malaysia, WHO together with other UN agencies supported Government in the preparation of the national SDG roadmap including engagement of civil society and the private sector through a consultative process.","7.

The first form was held in 2017.  \u2022\tWHO Neglected Tropical Diseases department convened its 2nd high-level Global Partners Meeting (19 April, Geneva, Switzerland) which focused on mainstreaming NTDs within the SDG agenda, with particular attention to UHC.  \u2022\tWHO HIV Department has convened regional capacity building workshops on implementing Treat All towards the SDG goals and universal health coverage.  These highlighted the challenges and special efforts needed to reach key populations, so no one is left behind.    Regional Level  \u2022\tTo ensure that PAHO\u2019s SDG-related activities are fully grounded in national and Regional priorities and circumstances, a series of national consultations have taken place both virtually and in-person. A regional workshop was held in Medellin, Colombia in November 2015 to enhance the capacities of PAHO Member States\u2019 country offices, health ministries, and other public institutions involved with the implementation of 2030 Agenda in the Americas.  Approximately 50 technical officers participated, representing about 20 countries of the region.  These consultations provided an opportunity for dialogue between PAHO and country representatives on programmatic and technical resources for the implementation of 2030 Agenda with a health lens; a platform to share and cross-reference national experiences in achieving SDG targets related directly or indirectly to health; and a recognition of the need for an integrated, multisectoral strategy to address health inequities, such as HiAP.  In addition, PAHO has been working with several institutions in the Region to strengthen country capacity on the actual implementation of the SDGs across the region.  A case in point is PAHO\u2019s collaboration with the Sustainable Development Solution Network and Funda\u00E7\u00E3o Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ), a Collaborating Center in Brazil, described below.    \u2022\tIn September 2015, a meeting of PAHO Collaborating Centers was held that was focused on environmental health strategy, with strong links to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its significance to research in this field going forward. Since then, PAHO has developed and circulated an advanced draft of the document \\\"Measuring Progress on Environmental Health through the Sustainable Development Goals\\\", following a workshop to discuss environmental health indicators related to the SDGs.  Several country profiles are now being prepared for countries throughout the Region, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia and the United States.    \u2022\tNumerous events and conferences have been organized in EURO.

Health sector leading the way on adapting SDGs in Kyrgyzstan08-06-2017  With support from WHO and other development partners, the Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan has become an active leader in setting priorities and adapting the SDGs to make implementation possible at the national level.  Better future: Health for all, all for health 19-05-2017  In September 2015, heads of state and government adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The United Nations emphasizes that everyone needs to play their part if the SDGs are to be reached: governments, the private sector and civil society. The 17 SDGs and their 169 associated targets are global in nature, universally applicable and interlinked. Health has a central place as a major contributor and beneficiary of sustainable development policies. SDG 3, \u201CHealth and well-being for all\u201D, is strengthened by the 13 health targets, and additional health-related targets are set out under other goals.  Reducing the SDG reporting burden: WHO\/Europe\u2019s initiative presented at the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development 09-05-2017  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development underscores the importance of \u201Cquality, accessible, timely and reliable disaggregated data \u2026 to help with the measurement of progress and to ensure that no one is left behind\u201D (Paragraph 48). Improving the collection, coordination, analysis and dissemination of data and building statistical capacities for monitoring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remain significant challenges for all countries in the WHO European Region and beyond.  WHO Regional Director for Europe highlights key health aspects for SDG implementation at the first Regional Forum on Sustainable Development 03-05-2017  The first Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Region took place in Geneva on 25 April 2017. The meeting was intended to follow up on and review progress towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the region. The Forum, which will be held annually, is designed to provide input from the UNECE region to the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), which oversees follow-up and review processes at the global level.  WHO European Healthy Cities Network adopts the P\u00E9cs Declaration14-03-2017  The WHO European Healthy Cities Network Annual Conference drew to a close on Friday 3 March, with mayors and political leaders adopting the 2017 Healthy Cities P\u00E9cs Declaration. This reconfirms their commitment to creating inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable societies.  First meeting of the Health and SDGs Expert Working Group provides input to roadmap for healthand sustainable development in the Region25-01-2017  In 2016, countries of the WHO European Region recognized that the Health 2020 policy framework and related World Health Assembly and Regional Committee resolutions provide a strong foundation upon which to position health at the centre of initiatives to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieve its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The WHO Regional Committee for Europe also endorsed the development of a roadmap to support countries in this endeavour.  Kick-off meeting of UN European coalition on health identifies 4 workstreams for joint action13-01-2017  The UN European coalition on health is a coordination mechanism focusing on the achievement of SDG 3 \u2013 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages \u2013 in the pan-European Region, and of the health-related targets present in other SDGs.  Communicating health and the Sustainable Development Goals: experiences from small countries of the WHO European Region01-11-2016  One of the 4 key action areas of WHO\/Europe\u2019s small countries initiative is to support the implementation of Health 2020 by better engaging the media as a partner. Collaborating with the media to raise awareness of health issues, goals and targets is also critical to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which calls for the involvement of civil society, the private sector and individuals from every country in order to hold governments accountable and ensure progress.  Ministers endorse joint statement on climate change and health at high-level meeting of small countries12-10-2016  Today, health ministers and policy-makers from eight European countries endorsed a statement that commits them to joining efforts in protecting people\u2019s health from adverse effects of climate change. The Third High-level Meeting of Small Countries, which includes WHO European countries with a population of less than one million, took place in Monaco on 11\u201312 October 2016 to strengthen collaboration in tackling today\u2019s complex health challenges.    New European platform for partnerships across sectors, United Nations agencies and civil society 13-12-2016  The second day of the high-level conference Working together for better health and well-being focused on how to implement intersectoral and cross-governmental policies. A common observation among delegates was the need to identify and communicate co-benefits for sectors other than health in order to generate effective, sustainable partnerships. They agreed to establish a new platform to improve and implement collaboration.  \u2022\t.  \u2022\tThe development of the action agenda was informed by a Member States meeting on achieving the SDGs in the Western Pacific in June 2016. Among other events, SDGs were the overarching focus at:  o\tThe 9th Global Conference on Health Promotion, Shanghai, 21-24 November 2016 \u2013 resulted in the Shanghai Declaration on promoting health in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.   o\tThe Asia-Pacific Parliamentarian Forum on Global Health, Seoul, 24-25 November 2016 \u2013 resulted in the Seoul Declaration (see also above).  o\tThe 2nd Regional Forum on WHO Collaborating Centres, 28-29 November 2016  o\tA global conference on Health in all Policies and the SDGs, Adelaide, 30-31 March 2017 \u2013 resulted in the Adelaide Statement II   \uF0A7\tA technical workshop on Indicators, Data & Methods for Monitoring SDG & UHC, 24-26 May 2017  \u2022\tIn follow up to the regional action framework on Universal Health Coverage: Moving Towards Better Health (WPR\/RC66.R2), the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific established a Universal Health Coverage Technical Advisory Group (UHC TAG) to review progress and provide advice to WHO and Member States on how to advance UHC in the Western Pacific Region. The UHC TAG meets annually in Manila; its third meeting is scheduled for November 2018.  \u2022\tThe theme of World Health Day 2018, celebrated on 7 April, will be \u201Cuniversal health coverage\u201D, providing an opportunity to raise awareness, review progress, and strengthen commitment to UHC\/SDGs.","8.

What key elements should it include and major challenges address in such a road map?":"Global Level  \u2022\\tShould include strong practical examples of cross-agency work in support of national 2030 agendas.  \u2022\tIt should redefine the focus on impact and in particularly country impact, and then cascade this down to how the UN is planning its activities and country capacity to support this.   Regional Level  \u2022\tA strategic plan for the UN System in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs should feature opportunities for building Member State capacity to collect, analyze and interpret data, and translate evidence into policy.  Robust, disaggregated data has been acknowledged as key to programming that addresses health inequities, a longstanding and intractable dynamic in the Region of the Americas.  \u2022\tWe also encourage use of systematic and formalized modes of two-way communications, for both sharing updates on progress and institutional guidance on ongoing trends and discussions concerning the 2030 Agenda.  \u2022\tGiven their comprehensive and interdependent nature, the SDGs challenge the UN system as well as Member States and partners to go beyond business as usual.

For the UN, capacity for more comparative analyses on key issues will be needed, which will be more complex than in the past due to the need to undertake more disaggregated analysis.   \u2022\tThe SDGs require new capabilities to advance whole-of-systems, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches that leave no-one behind.

{"show":1,"Organization":"World Bank Group","q1":"In April 2015, the multilateral development banks (MDBs) and the IMF produced a joint discussion note, \u201CFrom Billions to Trillions: Transforming Development Finance\u201D which proposed a preliminary vision for the collective role of these institutions looking toward the Addis Financing for Development conference. This was a testament that the World Bank Group (WBG) was to support the 2030 Agenda by tackling the FfD agenda, as the Means of Implementation to the SDGs.     Following the paradigm shift proposed in the Billions to Trillions narrative, the WBG 2015 Annual Meetings in Lima, the Development Committee discussion set the tone for our institution\u2019s work towards implementation of the SDGs in the document \u201CWBG Support for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\u201D Further, in 2016, a strategy paper, the \u201CForward Look \u2013 a Vision for the World Bank Group in 2030,\u201D set a common view among our shareholders on how to best support the development agenda for 2030; it also connects the Bank Group\u2019s institutional vision to the SDGs. The Forward Look encourages commitments and policies toward the global public goods agenda while (i) prioritizing private sector solutions before deploying scarce public resources, including for infrastructure; (ii) strengthening domestic resource mobilization; (iii) assisting all Bank Group clients, including low-income and middle-income countries; (iv) encouraging agility and results-focused work across the public and private sectors; and (v) paying attention to stabilizing the economy and supporting growth in situations of fragility, conflict and violence, as well as to the development needs of small states.      The Bank Group has set two goals for the world to achieve by 2030: ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. These goals need to be pursued in a sustainable manner: socially, economically, and environmentally.  We will achieve them in three ways:     1.\\tPromoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth, especially by helping countries create jobs and boost private investment in infrastructure.  2.\tInvesting in human capital, including early childhood development; equal opportunities in education, health, and training; and acquisition of job skills: areas that can make the biggest difference in countries\u2019 ability to grow and compete over the long term.   3.\tFostering resilience to global shocks and threats that could roll back development gains, by helping countries develop resilient infrastructure, invest in disaster risk preparedness, prepare for and respond to pandemics, and cope with forced migration.     Through our country engagement instruments, the WBG has taken several steps to align our work to the 2030 Agenda. This includes Country Partnership Frameworks and the new Environmental and Social Framework, which promotes inclusive development and aims to leave no one behind.     Further, the Bank Group Corporate Scorecards, which were endorsed in April 2014 to monitor the implementation of the Bank Group Strategy, are aligned with the 2030 Agenda. The Bank Group has assessed the strategic alignment of the SDGs\u2019 targets and indicators with the Bank Group\u2019s corporate results frameworks and the Results Measurement System (RMS) for the International Development Association (IDA). Starting in July 2017, new frameworks will take the SDGs into account in the Bank Group\u2019s business planning and monitoring. The Scorecards and IDA18 RMS will be consistent with and fully reflect the spirit of the SDGs while maintaining the ability to serve specific needs in monitoring the Bank Group\u2019s performance.    Based on the Addis Ababa Agenda for Action, the WBG has embarked on an effort to help countries maximize finance for development, and to do so responsibly without pushing the public sector into unsustainable levels of debt and contingent liabilities. This will entail pursuing private sector solutions where they can help achieve development goals, and reserving scarce public finance for where it is most needed. This approach builds on the Principles of MDBs Strategy for Crowding in Private Sector Finance for Growth and Sustainable Development (the \u201CHamburg Principles\u201D) and the Joint MDB Statement of Ambitions for Crowding in Private Finance, which commit MDBs to collectively increase private financing mobilized by 25-35 percent over the next three years.    This includes changes to the latest replenishment to the International Development Association (IDA), as a bold paradigm shift in how it mobilizes finance to support a significant policy package to help IDA clients achieve their development goals. It was the largest replenishment in IDA\u2019s 56-year history - approximately $75 billion- and heralds a significant step change in its policy and financing framework. In the Report from the Executive Directors of the International Development Association     to the Board of Governors it notes that the five Special Themes in IDA support growth, resilience and opportunity and are fully aligned with the SDGs.","q2_1":"To deliver on the vision of the WBG (outlined in question 1), the organization restructured itself by global themes to deliver the global solutions to the world’s most pressing development challenges. The new Global Practices are aligned to specific SDG goals, and includes several global cross-cutting areas (such as climate and fragility) to greater support this work. Understanding the interconnectedness of the SDGs, the WBG established in 2017 a new vice presidency, Global Themes. This new part of the WBG brings together five thematic areas that are priorities for the World Bank Group: Climate Change; Fragility, Conflict & Violence; Gender; Infrastructure, PPPs & Guarantees; and Knowledge Management and represent the big development challenges of our time. These are also fundamental to the twin goals of the WBG of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity as well as the 2030 Agenda.   Specific strategies, plans or work programmes - The WBG is working with client countries to deliver on the 2030 Agenda in three critical areas: data, finance, and implementation. In each, we support country-led and country-owned policies to attain the SDGs.    ","q2_2":"The WBG has a dedicated unit that focuses on the 2030 Agenda, under the auspices of the Senior Vice Presidency for the 2030 Development Agenda, United Nations Relations and Partnerships. The Vice President unit maintains extensive contacts throughout the WBG, the UN, and other partners to build and manage political, intergovernmental and inter-agency partnerships across a range of thematic and technical agendas. Led by Senior Vice President Mahmoud Mohieldin, the unit has offices in Washington, D.C., New York, and Geneva.","Readjusting or updating results-based budgeting and management, including performance indicators:":"The Bank Group Corporate Scorecards, endorsed in April 2014 to monitor the implementation of the Bank Group Strategy, are aligned with the 2030 Agenda. The Bank Group has assessed the strategic alignment of the SDGs’ targets and indicators with the Bank Group’s corporate results frameworks (in particular, the Scorecards) and the Results Measurement System (RMS) for the International Development Association (IDA).  These new frameworks take the SDGs into account in the Bank Group’s business planning and monitoring. The Scorecards and IDA18 RMS will be consistent with and fully reflect the spirit of the SDGs while maintaining the ability to serve specific needs in monitoring the Bank Group’s performance.","Action to enhance support to the principle of \"leaving no one behind\" and to integrated policy approaches:":"The World Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies work to support the policy of “leaving no one behind” and it is an example of how the Bank operationalizes this approach.  One such example are the safeguards that speak to vulnerable groups such as indigenous communities.  The Indigenous Peoples policy (Bank Operational Policy 4.10) ensures that the development process fully respects the dignity, human rights, economies, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples.    For all projects that are proposed for Bank financing and affect Indigenous Peoples, the Bank requires the Borrower to engage in a process of free, prior, and informed consultation. Bank-financed projects include measures (a) to avoid potentially adverse effects on the Indigenous Peoples’ communities; or (b) when avoidance is not feasible, to minimize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects.  ","Others:":"","Mainstreaming the SDGs in development plans and policies or through national sustainable development plans/strategies:":"The WBG has been appointed custodian over several SDG indicators and works collaboratively with several other UN entities to ensure monitoring of several others. The WBG also appointed an SDG indicator group which aims to provide input to the IAEG-SDG indicator process. Further to this, the WBG published Trajectories for Sustainable Development Goals: Framework and Country Applications in late 2015. This tool developed by the World Bank analyzes countries’ likely progress on SDGs and their determinants as well as discusses country policy and financing options that can accelerate progress. It looks at around 15 country examples that are geographically dispersed and include a mix of low-income, middle-income, landlocked, natural resource-rich, and small island countries.  The lessons learned could improve policymakers’ ability to identify and address opportunities and challenges for achieving the SDGs.  This also serves as a starting point for quantitative analysis for countries to better understand the policy and financial efforts needed to attain the SDGs.","Mainstreaming the SDGs in sectoral strategies, including specific SDG/target strategies:":"","Data and statistical capacity building:":"Globally, the Bank Group compiles data to track development progress, contributes to building standards and definitions for the SDG indicators, and works with others to maximize impact.  Some examples of this work are:  \\u2022\\tAt the country level, the Bank Group works to improve data production and use by funding improvements in partner country data. The Bank Group has about 300 active projects to support data improvements; we are providing about $200 million a year in financing for upgrades to key data collection as well as open data initiatives. In 2015, the Bank Group committed to helping countries complete at least one household survey every three years, with a focus on IDA countries. An estimated 111 surveys should be completed between 2017 and 2019.   \\u2022\tThe April 2017 edition of the Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals combines maps, charts and analysis to illustrate trends, challenges, and measurement issues related the 17 SDGs. The Atlas primarily draws on the World Development Indicators, the Bank Group\u2019s compilation of over 1,400 internationally comparable statistics about global development.  \\u2022\tThe Bank Group participates in the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators which defines the indicators the world will use to measure progress on the SDGs. The Bank Group is directly involved in reporting on 17 of these indicators (and, indirectly, many more). It leads on SDG 1 on poverty, both in terms of methodology and data.  \\u2022\tThe Bank Group is a major contributor to innovative approaches for filling gaps in SDG data production, access, and use. Working in close collaboration with the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, the Bank Group is providing funding and technical knowhow to pilot, test, and scale inventive uses of technology and new forms of collaboration among governments, civil society, and international organizations. The first installment of innovative financing will provide $3 million in support to a wide range of new projects.  ","Science, technology and innovation for the SDGs:":"The WBG supports the advancement of science, technology and innovation for development across all countries in which it operates.  There are some 1,600 STI initiatives, worth US$ 1 billion.  Some examples of how the Bank works to expand these services to countries are:  \\u2022\\tThe Bank Group\u2019s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) business plan is designed to deliver digital dividends by: expanding digital connectivity; adapting the legislative and policy environment; and developing integrated digital solutions through a range of products and services. It addresses changes in telecom policy and legislation; ICT sector reform and privatization; creation of new economy platforms and services; universal access to connectivity; and innovative business models for citizen engagement, government services, and digital capability. This responds to SDG targets and indicators (e.g., 5b, 9c) that call for enhancing access to, and quality of, ICT services. The plan also offers assistance to governments on disruptive and \u201Cover the horizon\u201D technologies like the Internet of things, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and drones in support of development goals.   \\u2022\tThe World Bank Group is working with governments to reach their objectives for Goal 7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all) which requires a concerted push on scaling up renewable technologies.  Some examples of our recent investments are: in India, the Bank provided $ 1 billion in lending for solar projects; and in China, $ 80 million was invested in a clean stove project, which provided 6 million clean stoves to the Hebei Province.    \\u2022\tThe Bank Group is accelerating efforts to expand access to electricity, by scaling up investments in both on- and off-grid solutions. The goal is to add 20 GW of renewable energy generation over five years and mobilize $25 billion in commercial funds for clean energy. In Africa alone, the Bank Group has committed to helping develop 5 GW of grid-connected solar energy projects and to providing 55 million off-grid consumers with modern energy services by 2026.  \\u2022\tSTI Forum: The World Bank Group is a member of the Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs.

Below are some examples of how the organization works with these organizations:    \\u2022\\tHigh-Level Panel on Water:  The World Bank Group President and UN Secretary General convened a high-level panel consisting of 11 sitting Heads of States and a Special Advisor.  The Bank Group is actively engaged and committed to contributing to the achievement of SDG 6 and all the SDGs that rely on water.     \\u2022\tPartnership with the UNICEF\/WHO Joint Monitoring Program: The Bank Group is the custodian agency for SDG indicators 6.1 (on drinking water) and 6.2 (on sanitation and hygiene); both of these define a \u201Csafely managed\u201D service level. The Bank Group is also working with various UN partners to define methodologies and collaborate on data gathering for the proposed indicators.  \\u2022\tThe UN and the Bank Group have produced a joint flagship publication, Prevention of Violent Conflict\/Pathways to Peace, that aims to improve understanding of how domestic policymaking and endogenous dynamics interact with development assistance, security, political, and human rights tools, to prevent conflict from becoming violent (SDG 16). The study has a strong focus on gender equality and on violence against women and children in crisis situations. It will identify ways that international assistance tools can shift local dynamics to reduce the risk of conflict.  \\u2022\tThe Bank Group and the UN also jointly support implementation of the humanitarian-development, peace, nexus, bringing together key elements of the Agenda for Humanity and UN resolutions of sustaining peace with the Bank Group\u2019s strong development engagement and implementation capacity in situations of fragility, conflict, and violence. The Bank Group launched Humanitarian-Development-Peace Initiative in northeast Nigeria in March 2017 to accelerate the delivery of a $775 million package of operations for early recovery and livelihood support in the region. That grant will pilot a new way of working with humanitarian, development, and peace actors to tackle an elevated risk of famine in a complex and multidimensional subnational crisis.   \\u2022\tIn April 2017, the Bank Group and the UN signed a partnership framework on building resilience and sustaining peace that encourages greater collaboration between the institutions and promotes work to reduce multidimensional risks of crisis and help prevent violent conflict.

In your view, what should a strategic plan for the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs look like? What key elements should it include and major challenges address in such a road map?":"The WBG approach to the SDGs is along three key areas of work (supported by partnerships): Finance, Data, and Implementation.   Regarding finance, the WBG (and other MDBs) will ensure that public and private investments are complementary and based on the Hamburg Principles adopted during the last G20 Summit. These principles essentially outline how the MDBs will help countries scale up their development resources by drawing appropriately on private sector solutions where these can boost growth for the poorest and most vulnerable. For the Bank Group, this includes an effort that brings together IDA, IFC, and MIGA to mobilize private investment and create markets in the most challenging environments.   Regarding data, the WBG has three main areas of work: strengthening partnerships, producing data and cross-country indicators, and fostering client country data production, dissemination, and use. This includes technical assistance on household survey programs and poverty mapping, inputs to the SDG indicator negotiations and custodian agency for several indicators (including SDG 1.1 on poverty), supporting the World Development Indicators and building the annual SDG Atlas, and working with partners, such as UNHCR on establishing a joint data center on forced displacement to improve statistics on refugees, and with Eurostat on producing international purchasing power parity estimates.

It provides for food security, human health, the provision of clean air and water; it contributes to local livelihoods, and economic development more generally. It is thus essential for the achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is for this reason that biodiversity and ecosystems are included throughout the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2013 not only in Goals 14 and 15, but in targets of many others Goals, including SDG 2 (food), 6 (water) 11 (cities), 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production). It is also a key factor to achieve other goals, in particular SDG 1 (poverty eradication). Global multilateral environmental agreements such as the CBD, together with its \u2018sister Conventions, the UNFCCC and the UNCCD have a key role to play in contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.    The 196 Parties to the CBD are currently implementing the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its twenty Aichi Biodiversity Targets, from which many elements have been drawn and\/or expanded in the 2030 Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the associated targets. The Vision and Mission of this plan make explicit reference to the benefits of biodiversity for all people, to poverty eradication and to human well-being. The Conference of the Parties (the governing body of the Convention), the Secretariat, and the Parties to the Convention are, respectively, providing guidance to implementation of, supporting the implementation of, or implementing the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. In doing so, they are simultaneously providing guidance to implementation of, supporting the implementation of, or implementing, the numerous relevant and interrelated goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda.    There are two Protocols under the Convention: The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, with currently 171 Parties, and the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization, with 104 Parties. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is also supplemented by the Nagoya \u2013 Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress which will enter into force on 5 March 2018 with 41 Parties. Their supreme governing bodies are the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to, respectively, the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols. Implementation of the Protocols also supports implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goals 2 (zero hunger), 3 (health), and 15 (life on land).    A description of the interrelations between the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2030 Agenda is provided in a technical note \u201CBiodiversity and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\u201D, available online:  https:\/\/www.cbd.int\/development\/doc\/biodiversity-2030-agenda-technical-note-en.pdf .    In addition to target 2.5 and 15.6 which are directly related to the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol; access and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources can be an instrument for integrating ecological, social and economic considerations, and therefore contribute to achieve the pertinent SDGs. This is described in the note below.  http:\/\/www.abs-initiative.info\/fileadmin\/media\/Knowledge_Center\/Pulications\/SDG\/Policy_Paper_-_How_ABS_and_Nagoya_Protocol_contribute_to_SDGs_-_201604.pdf     Because the many facets of the work under the Convention and its Protocols are so closely aligned with the 2030 Agenda, responding comprehensively to the questions below would lead to a very exhaustive document. Therefore, the responses below focus on the most important facets while specific examples are given for illustrative purposes only.    The vision of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, adopted by the Conference of the Parties in 2010, is: \\\"Living in Harmony with Nature\\\" where \\\"By 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people.\\\"    This 2050 vision was considered by the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) at its last meeting, in November 2017, in the context of the 2030 Agenda and the upcoming process under the Convention to develop a post-2020 Global Biodiversity framework, as a successor to the current Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets. As some of the targets in the SDGs are a direct reflection of the relevant Aichi Biodiversity Target including its 2020 timeline, this process is of direct relevance to the 2030 Agenda. See further information below.    The Conference of the Parties to the Convention has an established work stream on biodiversity and poverty alleviation and development (see further information under question 2). In this context, it has been active throughout the entire work process on the post-2015 development agenda which led to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015 (see decisions X\/6, XI\/22 and XII\/4).    The theme of the High Level Segment (HLS) during the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties, in 2014, was Biodiversity for Sustainable Development. The HLS adopted the Gangwon Declaration on Biodiversity for Sustainable Development, which highlighted why biodiversity is essential for sustainable development and why development pathways must ensure that the life support system underpinned by biodiversity is maintained. It also highlighted how the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets can contribute to the post-2015 development agenda and the principle of \u201Cleaving no one behind\u201D.  Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the Conference of the Parties adopted a number of decisions to guide its Parties, partners, stakeholders and the Secretariat in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.    Decision XIII\/3\\tStrategic Actions to Enhance the Implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity including with respect to mainstreaming and the integration of biodiversity within and across sectors    The COP welcomed the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals and recognized the strong interdependence between the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 2020 and the SDGs in which biodiversity is included in numerous goals and targets. It also recognized that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a major opportunity for the mainstreaming of biodiversity and for the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020;    The COP recognized the opportunities that arise from an integrated and mutually supportive implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 the 10 year strategic plan and framework to enhance implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (2008-2018), and the Reviewed Strategic Framework 2010-2019 of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for the achievement of internationally agreed goals and targets.    COP urged Parties, when implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to mainstream biodiversity in the implementation of all relevant Sustainable Development Goals, thus promoting linkages between efforts to implement NBSAPs and SDG strategies and plans, and called upon Parties and invites other Governments to consider utilizing an integrated approach towards achieving the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and implementation of NBSAPs;    The COP recognized that fundamental changes in consumption and production patterns to ensure sustainable production methods, as well as mutually supportive policy, legal, technical and financial measures in the agriculture, forests, fisheries and aquaculture, and tourism, among other sectors, are critical to meeting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.   Decision XIII\/3 highlighted the importance of strengthening the mainstreaming of biodiversity through relevant international processes to guide the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.   The COP recognized that mainstreaming of biodiversity across forests, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and tourism, among other sectors, is essential for halting the loss of biodiversity and achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and recalls the existing guidance under the Convention\u2019s work programmes, as well as the Plan of Action on Customary Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity.  The COP welcomed the Cancun Declaration on mainstreaming the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity for well-being, adopted during the high-level segment of the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, 2016, where ministers and other heads of delegation committed to integrating, in a structured and coherent manner, actions for the conservation, sustainable use, management and restoration of biological diversity and ecosystem services in sectoral and cross-sectoral policies, plans and programmes, as well as in legal and administrative measures and budgets;  The fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP-14), will consider the mainstreaming of biodiversity into the sectors of energy and mining, infrastructure, manufacturing and processing, as well as health.   The COP requested the Executive Secretary, to enhance multi-stakeholder partnerships, and initiatives, to provide support for the implementation of Goal A of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  Decision XIII\/1\tProgress in Implementation  The COP encouraged Parties to review their NBSAPs periodically, and to consider increasing the level of ambition and\/or scope of the national or regional targets to a level that is corresponding to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and to integrate the targets across different sectors, including in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, so as to make a greater contribution to collective global efforts to achieve the global targets;    The COP encouraged Parties when establishing or reviewing their national targets under the Convention, and when implementing their NBSAPs, to take into account relevant national and international targets under other processes, as appropriate, including targets of other relevant conventions and the Sustainable Development Goals, and also to mainstream biodiversity targets into the national and sub national strategies, action plans or policies of other sectors or processes when these are being reviewed;    The COP encouraged Parties, in the process of updating their NBSAPs, to consider, the indicators for the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals;    The COP initiated a process for considering the follow-up to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 as part of which it requested the Executive Secretary to prepare a further assessment, including a gap analysis, on the relationship between the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.    Decision XIII\/27 \tNational Reports  Parties to the Convention were required to submit national reports to the Secretariat on measures taken for the implementation of the Convention and their effectiveness. The national report guidance contained in Decision XIII\/27 asks countries to report on their contributions to the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and how and to what extent these contributions support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals.   Decision XIII\/4\tBiodiversity and Climate Change    The COP encouraged the Executive Secretary to promote synergies with the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, ensuring that this includes increasing knowledge and sharing of information, guidance and tools developed under the Convention on Biological Diversity relating to the impacts of climate change on biological diversity and the role of ecosystems for climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction, with a view to identifying possible solutions;  The full text of the decisions is available here:  https:\/\/www.cbd.int\/decisions\/cop\/?m=cop-13    Decision CP-VIII\/3\tCapacity-building    The COP\/MOP to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety urged Parties and other Governments to integrate biosafety in their national biodiversity strategies and actions plans and broader national development strategies in order to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals. It further encouraged Parties to continue to enhance capacity for, inter alia, initiatives for the Sustainable Development Goals, and requested the Secretariat to undertake regional and subregional workshops and other relevant activities in order to enhance the capacity of Parties to promote such integration.    Decision CP-VIII\/15\tThird assessment and review of the effectiveness of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and mid-term evaluation of the Strategic Plan    The COP-MOP to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety encouraged Parties to integrate training, public awareness, education and participation into a number of different initiatives including initiatives for the Sustainable Development Goals. It also requested the Executive Secretary to undertake activities to enhance the capacity of Parties to promote the integration of biosafety considerations into national strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.    SBSTTA recommendation XXI\/1\t\tThe 2050 Vision and the 2030 Agenda  The current Strategic Plan for Biodiversity expires in 2020 and a process is currently initiated under the Convention to develop a post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which would be adopted by CBD COP-15 in China, in 2020. The document provided under the link below provides initial conceptual considerations based on a first round of consultation with Parties, while the recommendation of the Convention\u2019s Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice provided pertinent recommendations including a draft decision for consideration by CBD COP-14, which will take place in Egypt in November 2018.    https:\/\/www.cbd.int\/doc\/c\/17f8\/406d\/f3184d92bff8f9506c1e985e\/sbstta-21-02-en.doc    https:\/\/www.cbd.int\/doc\/recommendations\/sbstta-21\/sbstta-21-rec-01-en.docx  ","q2_1":"The Secretariat is facilitating several streams of work under the Convention and under the Protocols, many of which are under formal programmes of work adopted by the Conference of the Parties or Plans of Action, that are taking steps in follow-up to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.

During COP-13 in Cancun, Mexico, in 2016, the High Level Segment focused on mainstreaming the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity for well-being, and adopted the Cancun Declaration in which Parties committed to undertake specific actions for mainstreaming biodiversity into the agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism sectors. As mentioned above, COP-13 adopted decision XIII/3 addressing inter alia the mainstreaming of biodiversity in these sectors, and also decided that COP-14 will address the mainstreaming of biodiversity in the sectors of energy and mining, infrastructure, manufacturing and processing, as well as health. These sectors are at the heart of the economic priorities of the SDGs, and the analytical and conceptual work required to adequately prepare the deliberations on this item at the meetings of the Conference of the Parties constitutes an increasingly important work area of the Secretariat.

As mentioned above, COP-13, in 2016 focused on mainstreaming in agriculture, forests, fisheries and tourism while COP-14, in December 2018 will focus on mainstreaming in energy and mining, infrastructure, manufacturing and processing, as well as health.   Decision XIII/3 as well as the 2016 Cancun Declaration, also mentioned above, provides guidance on the mainstreaming of biodiversity concerns into the management of sectors such as agriculture, forests, fisheries and tourism. This guidance acknowledges the importance of biodiversity for well being, health, sanitation, food security and hunger reduction, poverty eradication, prevention of natural disasters, resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities and human settlements and climate change adaptation and mitigation. It also integrates concerns for employment, decent work, poverty eradication and social inequality.   ","Data and statistical capacity building:":"See the capacity building work on financial reporting, referenced in the previous question.","Science, technology and innovation for the SDGs:":"The Secretariat, with support from the Republic of Korea, is implementing a programme, known as the Bio-Bridge Initiative, focused on catalyzing and facilitating technical and scientific cooperation and technology transfer among Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Protocols on Biosafety (Cartagena Protocol) and on Access and Benefit-sharing (Nagoya Protocol). The Initiative facilitates technical and scientific cooperation among Parties by linking Parties that have specific technical and scientific needs with Parties or institutions that are able to provide the necessary technical support and resources to meet those needs through mutual partnerships and creating a space for countries and institutions to share knowledge, good practices and lessons learned with each other. This is facilitated through the help desk service, the Bio-Bridge web platform and regional round tables. This will contribute to the implementation of biodiversity-related SDGs and their targets. See here:  https://www.cbd.int/biobridge/platform   ","Multi-stakeholder partnerships:":"Multi-stakeholder partnerships enhance the capacity of the Secretariat to provide normative, analytical, technical assistance or capacity building to Parties on a range of issue areas that support implementation of national biodiversity strategies and action plans, the Strategic Plan on Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and therefore the SDGs. The Secretariat coordinates or participates in the following multi-stakeholder partnerships: the Sustainable Ocean Initiative, the Global Islands Partnership, the Global Partnership on Local and Subnational Action for Biodiversity, the Global Platform for Business and Biodiversity and the Consortium of Scientific Partners on Biodiversity. (Interagency cooperation mechanisms are addressed under question 5).  Key activities of several of these multi-stakeholder partnerships are further described under different sections of the present document.  Global Islands Partnership  The Global Islands Partnership, GLISPA, created in 2018 to support implementation of the Programme of Work on Island Biodiversity, evolved into a multi-stakeholder platform focused mostly on the needs of SIDS, island Parties and Parties with islands, offering a technical and scientific cooperation platform for sustainable development and the SDGs. For more information see http://glispa.org/ .  ","Sub-national plans/strategies and implementation for the SDGs:":"As mentioned under question 2, the Secretariat and its partners provide normative, analytical, technical assistance or capacity building to Parties under various work streams. One of the work streams is on cities and subnational authorities.   Since 2008, the Convention has become active in promoting the development of subnational biodiversity and ecosystem service strategies and action plans. As these levels of government are even more sensitive to basic needs of citizens, and aware that the importance of the biodiversity agenda is linked to its contribution to sustainable development, this has made mainstreaming even more relevant. In 2010, along with the Strategic Plan 2011-2020, Parties adopted a Plan of Action for the engagement of sub-national governments, cities and other local authorities:  https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=12288    Subsequent decisions on this topic were taken at every Conference afterwards, including XIII/3, and the Secretariat and Parties coordinated their input into the New Urban Agenda arising out of the Habitat III process closed in Quito, Ecuador, in 2016. It is expected that this line of work will also be considered in the post 2020 framework.   ","Leveraging interlinkages across SDG goals and targets:":"In 2017, SCBD in collaboration with FAO, UNDP, UNEP, and the World Bank published a technical note on Biodiversity and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

This work also involved an analysis of gender integration in NBSAPs received by Parties since the establishment of the Convention (from 1993 to mid-2016) and gender integration into the most recent national reports received from Parties (5th national reports on the implementation of the Convention).    \\u2022\tPreparing informational and capacity building tools, including a pocket guide to the Gender Plan of Action providing a summary and examples of efforts by Parties to implement the Plan; a technical fact sheet on Sustainable Wildlife Management and Gender, produced on behalf of the Collaborative Partnership on Sustainable Wildlife Management; a factsheet on gender perspectives on biodiversity; and others \u2013 work which has benefited from the support of the Government of Canada, among others.   \\u2022\tUndertaking a participatory process to develop training tools on gender and biodiversity that target the South East Asia and Pacific regions, carried out with generous financial support from the Government of Sweden.  These tools are intended to strengthen capacity of national government institutions to address gender considerations in respect to biodiversity policy and programming.  \\u2022\tStrengthening advocacy and exchange on gender and biodiversity and related environmental issues, including through convening events on these issues at meetings under the Convention, and under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u2019s (UNFCCC) 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties, as well as engagement supporting training and related efforts by partners.    \\u2022\tPursuing efforts to harmonize approaches to capacity building and the achievement of shared gender objectives with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Rio Conventions (UNFCCC and UN Convention to Combat Climate Change), including through provision by the Secretariat of expert input into the development of gender plans of action under the UNFCCC and UNCCD.    Lessons learned from these processes include: the importance of building awareness, engagement and capacity on gender and biodiversity issues, in order to grow momentum and interest enough to realize progress.  Working towards the achievement of gender equality in respect to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, as in other processes, is a long term endeavor, which necessitates ongoing targeted investment and support from a range of partners.  There are clear opportunities to link with and build on the gender-biodiversity\/environment linkages in the SDGs with objectives and actions under the Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as related work with the Rio Conventions.    4\/Youth:  The Secretariat supports youth\u2019s efforts in implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Strategic Plan on Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets including by (i) facilitating registration and accreditation of youth groups at the meetings of the Convention and providing support for youth to carry out activities in the margins of the meetings; (iii) developing guidance and tools on youth and biodiversity; (iii) participating in the United Nations Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development; (iv) supporting resource mobilization for youth projects.  By supporting youth engagement in the implementation of the Convention and Strategic Plan on Biodiversity 2011-2020, the Secretariat contributes to strengthening the role of youth in the Sustainable Development Goals. In turn, youth contributes to better integrating biodiversity in SDG-related processes and implementation.  Over the last seven years, the Secretariat, with financial and other support provided by the Japan Biodiversity Fund and several CBD Parties, contributed to \u201CYouth Voices\u201D a project implemented by the Global Youth Biodiversity Network (GYBN), aimed at developing the capacities of youth to engage at the political level and in the implementation of the Convention and Aichi Biodiversity Targets and therefore the SDGs. GYBN is an inclusive and representative network of hundreds of youth organizations working on biodiversity. Through the project, GYBN reached out and trained hundreds of youth to participate in decision-making processes under the Convention, through \u201CRegional Youth Capacity-Building Workshops.\u201D  The network has a strong social media presence and will further develop online outreach and capacity-building tools and materials on youth and biodiversity. In particular, the publication \u201CCBD in a Nutshell\u201D developed by GYBN has become a flagship publication under the Convention. A second edition of the guidelines will be released in 2018.   In January 2018, GYBN in partnership with the UN Major Group for Children and Youth (UN MGCY) moderated a thematic breakout session on SDG15 of the ECOSOC Youth Forum, and organized a side-event on interlinkages between the SDGs and other sustainable development frameworks. The outcomes of the 2018 ECOSOC Youth Forum will serve as inputs to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF 2018).  ","7. Has your organization organized any conferences, forums or events designed to facilitate exchange of experience, peer and mutual learning? If yes, please provide a brief summary below and include lessons learned and gaps identified based on the outcomes of these events. Please also include any events you plan to organize in the coming years.":"The SCBD’s core business is the organization of conferences, meetings, or events designed to facilitate exchange of experience, peer and mutual learning. We organize numerous such events on a number of the topics covered by our mandate and the Strategic Plan on Biological Diversity 2011-2020. While some of these meetings pertain to the intergovernmental negotiations by which guidance from the governing body is issued on a biannual basis, many meetings are more technical in nature and are specifically for the exchange of experience and peer and mutual learning.  For a list of upcoming meetings and events, please consult https://www.cbd.int/meetings/  ","8. Is there any other information you would like to share, including annual reports of your organization and any impact assessment or evaluation reports? If yes, please use the space below and attach the document(s). Please also use this space to provide any other information, comments or remarks you deem necessary:":"The Secretariat publishes the Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO) every 4 years based on Parties national reports, scientific literature and other resources. The GBO provides a summary of the status of biological diversity and an analysis of the steps being taken by the global community to ensure that biodiversity is conserved and used sustainably, and that benefits arising from the use of genetic resources are shared equitably. Four editions of the report have been prepared and preparations for the fifth edition are currently underway. For more information: https://www.cbd.int/gbo/    ","9. In your view, what should a strategic plan for the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs look like? What key elements should it include and major challenges address in such a road map?":"Such a Strategic Plan of the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs could build on, and strengthen, the existing MAPS approach (Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support), which is already advanced by the 32 member agencies of the UN Development Group.  https:\/\/undg.org\/about\/undg-global\/undg\/  http:\/\/www.undp.org\/content\/undp\/en\/home\/blog\/2018\/how-will-we-navigate-towards-2030--well-be-using-maps-.html  \\u2022\\tUnder a Mainstreaming strategic objective, the Convention and its Secretariat could help providing SDG-specific guidance and support to UN Country Teams and Member States. In its contribution, the Secretariat could build on its existing analysis and guidance on the fundamental role of biodiversity in supporting the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, including in particular its essential role in providing ecosystems services that are critical for livelihoods and for human wellbeing (see links provided above), as well as on its pertinent work on biodiversity mainstreaming, both cross-sectorial and in economic sectors (see references provided above). This could contribute to the overarching aim to implement the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals in an integrated manner \u2013 thus reflecting the indivisible nature of the framework.  \\u2022\tUnder an Acceleration strategic objective, the Convention and its Secretariat could provide targeted advice and specific tools supporting the three areas already advanced by the acceleration component of the UN MAPS approach, including: (i) integrated analysis and assessment of SDG interconnections; (ii) \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 analysis tools; and (iii) risk-informed development planning tools. Moreover, the joint conceptual work on transformational change and on resilience, suggested under question 10 below, could also feed into achieving this objective.  o\tThe CBD Secretariat uses already integrated environmental assessment approaches and methodologies for its flagship Global Biodiversity Outlook, among other useful tools, and could share its experiences and lessons learned.  o\tThe Convention and the Secretariat undertook considerable analytical work on the linkages between biodiversity and poverty alleviation (see for instance https:\/\/www.cbd.int\/doc\/publications\/cbd-ts-55-en.pdf ), which could be put to good use in highlighting, in the \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 analysis tools, the role of ecosystems and underpinning biodiversity in maintaining livelihoods of the rural poor and indigenous and local communities.  o\tSimilarly, biodiversity is recognized as critical for ecosystem resilience, with pertinent scientific research evolving dynamically, and the Convention could contribute expertise and channel the pertinent experience of its Parties in the development of risk-informed development planning tools.  \\u2022\tUnder a Policy Support strategic objective, the Convention and its Secretariat could provide SDG-specific support:  o\ton data and indicators, including guidance for reporting under the HLPF\u2019s Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) and country-specific SDG reporting. The Secretariat is already communicating with Parties to the Convention on supporting the biodiversity aspects of voluntary reporting to the HLPF and on the merits of considering the broader indicator framework developed under the Convention for tracking progress against the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in reporting progress against the SDGs.  o\tOn relevant policy tools measures, such as environmental impact assessments, strategic impact assessments, or incentive measures, where the Convention and its Secretariat has also a considerable repository of expertise and guidance already developed.  More generally, key elements of the strategic plan for the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs could include:  \\u2022\ta review of the current functions and existing capacities of the UN development system in achieving the 2030 Agenda and SDGs;  \\u2022\tbuilding on insights in addressing gaps and overlaps in support of the SDGs, repositioning development at the highest levels of the organization, to support and enable results at the country level;  \\u2022\tcapacity building and support to countries for implementing the SDGs and relevant multilateral environmental agreements in a coherent manner  \\u2022\telements to improve governance, including strengthened oversight by Member States and increased transparency on system-wide results.  Some major challenges to address could be the capacity gaps to support policy integration, data management, partnerships and financing, but also the challenges associated with enhancing coordination and collaboration.  ","10. Please indicate one or two endeavor or initiatives you suggest that the UN system organizations could undertake together to support the implementation of the SDGs between now and 2030:":"As explained above, implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 has direct bearing on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. However, the current Strategic Plan for Biodiversity expires in 2020 and a process is currently initiated under the Convention to work out a post-2020 strategic biodiversity framework, which would be adopted by CBD COP-15 in China, in 2020. This provides a strategic opportunity to align even more closely the global biodiversity policy agenda with the 2030 agenda, including, but not limited to, providing updates to those targets under the SDGs which, as they originated from the current Strategic Plan for biodiversity, also have a 2020 timeline. Achieving this alignment will require collaboration and will facilitate implementing the Strategic Plan of the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs in a coherent and synergistic manner.  An important initiative that the UN system could potentially undertake together is to further elaborate and operationalize the concepts of ‘Transformation’ and ‘Resilience’. Both are thematic foci of the 2018 HLPF, and the former is actually the leading title to the 2030 Agenda itself – ‘Transforming Our World’. Both topics are fundamentally important to the work of the Convention and its Secretariat, due to the urgent imperative of achieving transformational change for attaining the objectives of the Convention, and due to the essential role of biodiversity in ecosystem resilience and, ultimately, in supporting resilient societies (for example, in the context of ecosystem-based climate change mitigation and adaptation and of ecosystem-based disaster risk prevention).  Another initiative that the UN system organizations could undertake together to support the implementation of the SDGs between now and 2030 could be to perhaps put more emphasis on support at the sub national and local levels. The multi-agency working group established by the UN Secretariat with the assistance of UN Habitat, for the implementation of the New Urban Agenda, could provide an important opportunity and entry point for this area of work.
