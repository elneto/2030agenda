		"q1":  "<p>ECLAC has mainstreamed the 2030 Agenda and its follow-up in its main general governing bodies, particularly in the context of its Session of the Commission in which Commission’s programme of work is presented and submitted to its Member states. As an example, at the XXXVI Session of the Commission in 2016, the 2030 Agenda was at the heart of both the programme and discussions of the meeting (<a href=\"https://periododesesiones.cepal.org/36/en\">https://periododesesiones.cepal.org/36/en</a>). Moreover the Position Document presented to governments in this occasion entitled Horizons 2030: Equality at the centre of sustainable development  explicitly intertwined ECLAC’s analysis and policy recommendations with the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda.</p><p>Also, at the request of member states, in April 2017 ECLAC held the first Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, the regional mechanism to follow up and review the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its means of implementation, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Each year ECLAC presents an Annual report on regional progress and challenges in relation to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Latin America and the Caribbean (https://foroalc2030.cepal.org/2017/en/documents/annual-report-regional-progress-and-challenges-relation-2030-agenda-sustainable). Close to 800 participants representing 31 out of 33 governments of the region, 27 UN Entities, civil society, private sector and other stakeholders participated in a set of dialogues on eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world in the framework of sustainable development. Countries presenting their Voluntary National Review participated in peer learning sessions on topics revolving around institutional arrangements and the challenges related to the measurement of the SDG indicators, and the means of implementation, among others.  In their intergovernmentally agreed conclusions and recommendations, member-states reaffirmed their commitment to implement the agenda. It is important to note that these agreements, the report and the summary of the Chair are inputs to the the High-Level Political Forum. Through the modality of work adopted at its first meeting, the Forum proved to be the proper regional space for peer learning, sharing common experiences on the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. At the same time, it allowed for the participation of multiple regional stakeholders that differed from those normally participating at the global level.</p><p>With regards to the 2030 Agenda, ECLAC has identified in close consultation and dialogue with its Member States four key priority areas:</p><p>1) Supporting member States in the implementation, follow-up and review of the 2030 Development Agenda, including the SDGS through regional and inter-agency coordination. The establishment of the Forum of LAC countries on sustainable development is an important step in this direction since it will significantly unify the regional voices in global debates as well as enhance peer learning at the regional and sub-regional levels. The regional voice will in turn allow UN entities to identify national tasks to support country implementation.</p><p>2)  Promoting the integration of the SDGs into national and territorial planning, budgeting and investment schemes in collaboration with the UN-system at the regional and national levels;</p><p>3) Strengthening national capacities in statistics and indicators related to the measurement of SDGs in the context of the data revolution, with disaggregation, geospatial referencing and localization; and</p><p>4) Supporting the design and follow-up of means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the regional level and analyzing key policy interlinkages, on topics related to trade, financing for development, technology transfer, rules of engagement with the private sector, among others.</p><p>5) Provide a meaningful multistakeholder engagement platform. ECLAC is developing a course with UNITAR for Agenda 2030 implementers, diplomats and other stakeholders (private sector, civil society, etc.)</p><p>Implementing these priorities requires close coordination with UN entities at the regional and sub-regional levels.</p>",
		"q2_1":  "<p>The programme of work and activities of ECLAC have gradually been adapted to meet the 2030 Development Agenda’s main priorities. This entails framing topics previously developed (such as poverty, inequality, social protection, decent work, education, institutional analysis, youth, infancy, and disability among others) from the perspective of specific SDG’s. Also new extra-budgetary projects have been designed in reference to the main priorities emerging from the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>In addition, in some of its latest main reports, ECLAC has developed a framework to analyze the social pillar of the Agenda and its linkages with the economic and environmental dimensions. More specifically, the position document presented in 2015 at the First Regional Conference on Social Development included a chapter addressing “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the regional agenda for inclusive social development: Latin American and Caribbean challenges and synergies”. Finally, the position document presented in 2017 at the Second Regional Conference on Social Development also contained “Chapter I. Equality at the centre of sustainable development ” developing the implications of the social dimension of the 2030 Agenda with its economic, environmental and institutional aspects, thus identifying an “extended” social pillar gathering specific goals that are essential to achieve advances in social development.</p><p>In March 2017 ECLAC organized an internal workshop called “Mainstreaming gender in the 2030 Agenda: A commitment by ECLAC to women’s rights and autonomy” with the participation of directors and staff of the divisions and the sub-regional and national offices.</p><p>ECLAC Office in Bogotá has focused its studies on development lines related to the following SDGs:</p><p>1. Eradicate poverty (SDG 1) and reduce inequality (SDG 10): by analyzing the social protection system challenges in Colombia.</p><p>2. Promote sustainable cities and communities (SDG 8): by its contribution to the government’s Misión del Sistema de Ciudades and Misión para la transformación del campo, and by studying rural public goods, rural-urban linkages and territorial configurations for development .</p><p>3. Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9): by the elaboration of the Competitiveness ranking of Colombian departments (2000-2017).</p>",		
		"q2_2":  "<p>The creation of an interdivisional 2030 Agenda working group that has met every trimester since January 2014 in order to discuss multidisciplinary issues relevant to the work of ECLAC related to the 2030 Agenda and produce joint outputs.</p><p>ECLAC also has an interdivisional Working Group on Measuring SDG indicators.</p>",
		"q2_3":  "<p>One example at ECLAC is the area of natural resources and infrastructure:</p><p>1.The reference to SDGs and Agenda 2030 were included in the work programme, ear-marking several analytical publications and expert meetings to the Agenda 2030 related issues.</p><p>2.In line with the indivisible nature of Agenda 2030, the cooperation between sectoral areas was intensified, resulting, inter alia, into identifying synergies between the infrastructure and a more sustainable use of natural resources</p><p>3.Performance indicators were adjusted to measure the progress in improving the infrastructure policies in line with the needs of the Agenda 2030</p><p>4.Increased attention is given to the issues of connectivity and access to infrastructure services at the national and regional level.</p>",
		"q2_4":  "<p>In relation to advancing in “leaving no one behind”, ECLAC has conducted important analytical work in order to identify some of the most important factors (socio-economic status, gender, age, territory and race and ethnicity ) contributing to social inequality in all realms and how they interact and often reinforce each other, in what has been described as a “Social inequality matrix”. Also, this has involved a systematic effort to visualize the condition of people of African descent, a population group that is often ignored by public policies in Latin America. In that regard, the SDD has developed new statistical information and data, as well as policy and institutional recommendations that were recently summarized in the publication “Situación de las personas afrodescendientes en América Latina y desafíos de políticas para la garantía de sus derechos”. A similar effort is being conducted in relation to other population groups such as people with disabilities, youth, children (particularly in relation to child labour) and migrants.</p>",
		"q2_5":  "",
		"q3_1":  "<p>Further, in pursuant to the Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee (CDCC) Resolution 94(XXVI), ECLAC, through its subregional headquarters for the Caribbean is currently providing technical assistance to Member States in the development of integrated long-term development planning that incorporates the SDGs, the development of institutional frameworks for SDG implementation at the national level, and statistical capacity strengthening for the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>The technical assistance activities being implemented by ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean are centered on the principle of “leaving no one behind” and are specifically targeted at integrated policy approaches.  These technical assistance activities are aimed at developing institutional capacities for integrating the SIDS development agenda, the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and national development priority in a holistic manner. Also, the CDCC, through resolution 94(XXVI) requested “the secretariat of the Commission, through its subregional headquarters for the Caribbean and in collaboration with the relevant agencies of the United Nations system and the Caribbean Community, to provide the institutional support to facilitate synergy in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway at the national and regional levels.”</p><p>Beginning in February 2018, ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean will implement a Development Account project on “Strengthening institutional frameworks in the Caribbean for an integrative approach to implement the 2030 Agenda and the SIDS Sustainable Development Agenda.” This project is designed to strengthen the institutional capacities of six Caribbean countries for national development planning and integrates the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SIDS agenda in the subregion.  Through this project, beneficiary countries will improve their capacities to design and implement evidence-based development planning and be better positioned to review and follow-up on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Proposed activities under this project include national assessments of the status of development plans and their implementation, national workshops on the process of development planning and integration of the 2030 Agenda, technical assistance in the integration of the SDGs and the SIDS agenda into long-term national development plans, national assessments of the capacity of national statistical systems to produce data for measuring progress in the implementation of the SDGs and the SIDS agenda, technical meetings to address the data requirements for monitoring the progress in implementation of the integrated national development plans, the design of a monitoring framework for adoption in beneficiary countries, and subregional workshops to facilitate peer learning among Caribbean countries.</p><p>Since planning is one mean of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the Latin-American and Caribbean Institute for Economic and Social planning fully incorporated the Agenda and the SDGs in its work plan to support Member States in the definition of development plans and strategies to achieve the SDG’s.   It implied a thorough revision and update of both, the methodologies and contents of training courses as well as technical assistance tools.  It also implied the revision of the research agenda in order to mainstream the renewed global agreements.</p><p>In this context, several initiatives have been undertaken:</p><p>-The construction and launching of the Regional Observatory on Planning for Development of Latin America and the Caribbean.  This regional Observatory fostered a dynamic space for analysis, sharing of information and collective knowledge generation and sharing on planning for development and public management.   It is meant to support countries of Latin America and the Caribbean region in the strengthening and improvement of their planning systems and processes and to align their development planning efforts to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs according to their own priorities and national and subnational contexts and situations.</p><p>-The design and application of Planbarómetro at national, regional and local levels in five different countries (Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay and Costa Rica).  It is a tool designed to improve the quality of planning processes assessing them under three different models (national, subnational and sectoral) five different dimensions (global, institutional, design, implementation, and results of the plan); three different context of analysis (system, process, tool) and 34 criteria including coordination, participation, stakeholder analysis, monitoring, among others.  Planbarómetro also includes the criteria on SDGs alignment.</p><p>-Program for the strengthening of capacities on Planning for implementing the 2030 Agenda. The program aims at delivering tools and methodologies to support countries in their efforts to adapt the Agenda to their national and sub-national situations and generate plans and strategies to implement it.  The program has been already implemented in Guatemala, Honduras, by the regional government of Tucuman and by the Association of Caribbean States and has been co-organized, in each case, together with the governmental counterpart.</p><p>Different countries received assistance on the preparation of the national gender equality plans, which are correlated with the national development plans within the framework of the commitments adopted by the countries in regard to the 2030 Agenda. In 2017, ECLAC worked jointly with the governments of Chile and Costa Rica, in the process of the elaboration of their 2018-2030 national equality plans.For example, in the case of Chile, ECLAC gave technical support to the Women’s Ministry in the development of a participatory methodology for preparing the national equality plan in the framework of the Montevideo Strategy and the SDGs.</p>",
		"q3_2":  "<p>Natural resources and infrastructure</p><p>During the 2016 Ministerial Meeting in the occasion of the ECLAC Governance Week on Natural Resources and Infrastructure (7-11 November 2016), the ministerial delegations of Latin America and the Caribbean adopted a series of recommendations on infrastructure governance, which emphasized the cross-cutting linkages between infrastructure and sustainable development and SDGs and identified the actions to be carried out to enhance the infrastructure governance in the region in line with the needs of the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>ECLAC capacity building workshops on national logistics and mobility policies, carried out in twelve Latin American and Caribbean countries, provided a methodology and tools to link these national policies to progress on the implementation of SDGs. ECLAC also intensified the work on reliable indicators on infrastructure to measure the progress on SDG 9, which resulted in a launch of INFRALATAM \u2013 a joint ECLAC/IDB/CAF portal offering information on the past and current infrastructure investment levels in the ECLAC region.</p><p>In 2016 ECLAC launched the regional dialogue on infrastructure governance, whose overarching goal is to create a multi-level and multi-stakeholder partnerships and platforms and promote the national and regional policies for infrastructure development in line with the needs of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.</p><p>Related to SDG 6, ECLAC has produced the studies \"Am\u00E9rica Latina y el Caribe hacia los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible en agua y saneamiento: Reformas recientes de las pol\u00EDticas sectoriales\" (LC/TS.2017/17, marzo de 2017, Serie Recursos Naturales e Infraestructura No. 180), \"El Nexo entre el agua, la energ\u00EDa y la alimentaci\u00F3n en Am\u00E9rica Latina y el Caribe: planificaci\u00F3n, marco normativo e identificaci\u00F3n de interconexiones prioritarias\" (LC/TS.2017/16, marzo de 2017, Serie Recursos Naturales e Infraestructura No. 179) and organized an expert group meeting entitled \u201CGobernanza del Nexo Agua, Energ\u00EDa y Alimentaci\u00F3n: Desaf\u00EDos de la Agenda 2030 en Agua y Saneamiento\u201D (Antigua, Guatemala, 6 al 7 de septiembre de 2016).</p><p>Beginning in February 2018, ECLAC will begin its Development Account project \"Regional Observatory on Renewable Energies - ROSE\" (2018-2021), whose primary objective will be to support the countries of the region in monitoring progress towards achievement of SDG7 (energy). Specific objectives include: i) creating solid national databases in the three sectors related to SDG7 (access, renewables, efficiency); ii) develop and interpret sectoral indicators to refine / adapt national policies for SDG7; iii) conduct \"capacity building\" of public officials in the collection, analysis and use of energy data to monitor progress towards SDG7; iv) create synergies and exchanges between the different national and regional stakeholders involved in the SDG7 process.</p><p>In 2017, ECLAC formulated a project for the UN Development Account named \u201CRural-Urban linkages for inclusive development policies in Colombia\u201D, which aims at moving forward towards the implementation of the Agenda in SDGs goals 8, 9, 11, 15 and 17. The project has a four-year implementation period (2018-2022).</p><p>Social Affairs</p><p>ECLAC provides technical assistance in social matters, as requested by governments, on a number of topics directly linked to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. Currently the main subjects addressed lately are social protection (El Salvador, Haiti, Paraguay and Paraguay), education and information technologies (Costa Rica) and the rights of persons with disabilities (Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico). Moreover the SDD has provided extensive assistance regarding the improvement of the measurement of public social spending to all governments, an essential means of implementation of the social dimension of the 2030 Agenda, allowing the development of a database on the subject (https://observatoriosocial.cepal.org/inversion/en). Some specific topics in which ECLAC conducts technical assistance and data capacity building related to the SDGs are disability, child labour, and child poverty.</p><p>Further, ECLAC implemented in 2016-2017 both analytical and knowledge sharing events aimed at mainstreaming themes of sustainable development in policies and sectoral strategies as they relate to international trade, published the book \u201CThe contribution of fair trade to sustainable development\u201D and co-organized a book launch seminar that brought together experts to present and discuss various country experiences in the region in relation to public policies oriented towards sustainable development. Also, to study the relationship between trade and sustainable development from a regional perspective, ECLAC published, \u201CEffects of an exogenous shock on trade on employment and wages of manufacturing companies in Colombia\u201D, which analyzes the impact on employment and wages at the company level of the negative shock in the exports of manufacturing firms from Colombia to Venezuela after the severance of diplomatic relations with that country at the end of 2008.</p><p>The Social Development Ministries and similar institutions of Latin America and the Caribbean are the main counterparts of ECLAC in the context of the Regional Conference of Social Development. Such entities need substantive technical and political support to fulfil complex tasks involving poverty eradication, fighting inequality and often have the mandate of implementing policies to improve the wellbeing and rights of specific population groups such as children, youth, the elderly, and persons with disabilities among others. In this context ECLAC has developed an extensive analysis of the programmatic and institutional framework of social policies in general (and social protection systems in particular) in order to promote their consolidation and coherence as an essential aspect to improve the effectiveness of social development policies. Also, ECLAC has been requested by governments of the region to further develop the analysis of the multiple manifestations of inequality and its effects. More specifically, several publications have addressed these aspects (The social inequality matrix in Latin America, Towards universal social protection: Latin American pathways and policy tools and Social Institutions in Latin America are recent examples). Also, several databases have been developed to provide stakeholders extensive information on these aspects (social pensions, conditional cash transfers, productive and employment inclusion programmes, social institutions and a Youth Observatory).</p><p>Financing for Development and Taxation</p><p>ECLAC has also produced significant analytical work related to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Latin America and the Caribbean, creating greater awareness of the Agenda in the region and policy options for countries to consider in crafting nationally appropriate development strategies. A major topic of concern in recent years as related to the 2030 Agenda has been the challenge of generating sufficient resources to finance sustainable development. To that end, in 2016 ECLAC launched the Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean 2016: 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the challenges of financing for development, which explored challenges to domestic resource mobilization in the region \u2013 with special focus on evasion arising from international operations by multinational enterprises and high net worth individuals \u2013 as well exploring external private sector financial flows, financial inclusion and innovation.</p><p>This work was further bolstered by the Fiscal Panorama of Latin America and the Caribbean 2017: Mobilizing resources to finance sustainable development which analyzed in depth issues relating to improving the progressivity of the tax system to tackle inequality, the adoption of environmental taxes to combat climate change, and fiscal policies to reduce territorial inequality in countries and strengthen sub-national public finances.</p><p>In the context of slow economic growth in Latin America, a key challenge for meeting the SDGs is the recovery of investment and growth. To that end, ECLAC has created knowledge and understanding among the region\u2019s policymakers about the characteristics of the current economic cycle, how it compares with previous cycles, and what are potential policy options for accelerating growth and investment with the aim to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth in line with the 2030 Agenda. The 2017 Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean, \u201CDynamics of the current economic cycle and policy challenges for boosting investment and growth\u201D, explored these issues in depth and was widely cited in the regional press.</p><p>ECLAC has also worked extensively on issues related to SDG 8, specifically in aspects related to technical and vocational education and training, and the protection of the unemployed and publishes jointly with ILO  bi-annual reports on key labour market topics for the region: recent editions examined the school-to-work transition of young people, the integration of migrants into Latin American labor markets, global value chains and employment in Latin America, rural-urban employment gaps, among others.</p><p>Moreover, ECLAC has sought to provide policymakers with data, cross-country/regional analysis, and policy options to tackle aspects of SDGs 10 and 17. ECLAC has also produced estimates of illicit financial flows (IFFs) due to the manipulation of international trade prices for the region, in line with the mandate included in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. ECLAC\u2019s analysis and policy advocacy for improving the region\u2019s tax structure to achieve greater equality has resonated in the region and has become a leitmotif in recent reforms.</p><p>To overcome the shortcomings of the income per capita as an ODA allocation approach, ECLAC has proposed a new perspective that can be complementary which we call the Structural Gap Approach. This approach identifies key structural obstacles that are holding back sustained, equitable and inclusive growth for middle income countries. It includes 12 additional indicators in terms of inequality and poverty, debt ratio, investment and saving, productivity and innovation, infrastructure, education, health, taxation, gender and the environment. ECLAC provided technical assistance to Costa Rica and worked with several of its ministries to draft the report Structural gap Approach. An analysis of the case of Costa Rica (LC/L.42765) was presented at a formal launch with key government officials. The document was coordinated by ECLAC and the Ministries of Planning and Foreign Relations of Costa Rica.</p><p>Further, the 2030 Agenda presents a unique opportunity to promote new instruments and innovative mechanisms for financing social and production development in Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201CGreen bonds\u201D are an example of alternative financial instruments becoming increasingly available to investors. New innovative securities are helping accomplish two goals: a) allocate funds to bridge the development gap and b) encourage investment in sustainable development projects that support environmental or ecologically-friendly causes. The drive towards green finance has been supported by two other underlying forces as well, one of a political and regulatory nature: the efforts unleashed by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the need to finance US$ 1 trillion a year in investments for renewable energy and other initiatives to limit global warming; and another market-driven: the increasing financial appeal of green investment, as clean technology matures and costs of installing solar and wind energy come down, erasing the need for subsidies.</p><p>Since the beginning of 2016, ECLAC has been monitoring the issuance of green bonds (as well as social and sustainable bonds) by Latin American and Caribbean issuers in international bond markets, for inclusion in the periodic report \u201CCapital Flows to Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201D A special section on green bond issuance has been added to the report since then. So far, six reports with a special section on green bonds were published in 2016 and 2017.</p><p>In addition, in October 2017 the report \u201CThe rise of green bonds: financing for development in Latin America and the Caribbean\u201D was published. This report examines the growing green bond market, with emphasis on Latin America and the Caribbean, showing that between 2014 and 2017 (as of August 31), the region issued US$ 8.4 billion in bonds with a green focus in local and international markets. The bulk of the region\u2019s green-focused bonds \u2013 US$ 7.1 billion (84%) \u2013 were issued in international markets. On average, these bonds represented only 1.6% of the total Latin American and Caribbean bond issuance in international markets in the period. In the first half of 2017, however, they accounted for 3.7% of the region\u2019s total international debt issuance. If this share continues on an upward trend, green bonds could play a more significant role in the mobilization of resources for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Latin American and the Caribbean. The strategy is to continue this line of research and work, looking to deepen the data and statistical capacity building with respect to green as well as sustainable bond issuance.</p><p>Climate Change</p><p>Technical assistance were provided to the Government of the Dominican Republic, represented by the National Council on Climate Change and the Clean Development Mechanism (CNCCMDL), in the preparation and discussion of the goals to be included in their INDCs. In particular, technical studies were prepared to calculate baselines of emissions and structural models to discuss the macroeconomic and distributive effects of climate change mitigation policies. These inputs were presented, discussed and adjusted during national workshops attended by the Ministries of Finance, Environment and Natural Resources, Economy, Planning and Development, among other institutions. The INDC was submitted to the UNFCCC by the Government and a roadmap was prepared for compliance, which includes inputs prepared during the technical assistance.</p>",
